Lyrics:
Hang all the mistletoe
I'm gonna get to know you better, yeah
This Christmas
And as we trim the tree
How much fun is it going to be together? Yeah, ha
This Christmas
Fireside is blazing bright
We're caroling through the night
And this Christmas will be, yeah
A very special Christmas for me, yeah
Yeah, oh (alright)
Hey, ooh

A sea of hearts beat as one, unified
Magnification
All generations
Approaching thunder awaiting the light

Exhilaration
Frenzied sensation 
Kindred alliance connected inside
Commiseration
Sonic salvation
Cast out the demons that strangle your life

Kill isolation
Never alone for the feelings alike

Lyrics:

Girl, understand why
See it's burning me to hold onto this
I know this is something I gotta do
But that don't mean I want to
What I'm trying to say is that I-love-you I just
I feel like this is coming to an end
And its better for me to let it go now than hold on and hurt you
I gotta let it burn

It's gonna burn for me to say this
But it's coming from my heart
It's been a longtime coming
But we done been fell apart
Really wanna work this out
But I don't think you're gonna change ya
I do but you don't
Think it's best we go our separate ways
Tell me why I should stay in this relationship
When I'm hurting baby, I ain't happy baby
Plus theres so many other things I gotta deal with
I think that you should let it burn

When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go cause the party ain't jumpin' like it used to
Even though thismight bruise you
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over
You know that it was through
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn""",0.477,32928.0,album,https://open.spotify.com/artist/23zg3TcAtWQy7J6upgbUnj,0.796,231933.0,True,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5XNWFw5HVw,Confessions (Expanded Edition),"4,458.7",1.214,13.0,1991–present,United States,80 million,R&B / pop,1994,76.6 million

Lyrics:

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart

Life goes on as it never ends
Eyes of stone observe the trends
They never say forever gaze if only
Guilty roads to an endless love (endless love)
There's no control
Are you with me now?
Your every wish will be done

Order the 25th anniversary album:  http://found.ee/REM-automatic25-r

R.E.M. is excited to announce the reissue of their landmark album Automatic For The People to commemorate the record's 25th Anniversary. Due November 10 via Craft Recordings, the remastered album will be available in a variety of formats, the most extensive of which is the Deluxe Anniversary Edition, which will feature the album in its entirety mixed in Dolby Atmos.
 
The album (plus bonus track “Photograph,” featuring Natalie Merchant) was remixed in Dolby Atmos by Automatic’s original producer, Scott Litt, and engineer, Clif Norrell. This technology delivers a leap forward from surround sound with expansive, flowing audio that immerses the listener far beyond what stereo can offer. It transports the listener inside the recording studio with multi-dimensional audio – evoking a time when listening to music was an active, transformative experience, and reigniting the emotion you felt when you first heard the album in 1992.  R.E.M.’s Automatic For The People is the first album to be commercially released in this expressive, breathtaking format.

In addition, the 4-disc Deluxe Edition will offer a wealth of previously unreleased material. The band selected 20 never-before-heard demos from the LP’s sessions, including the fully-realized, unreleased track “Mike’s Pop Song” and the oft-mused about song, “Devil Rides Backwards.”

Lyrics:
I was sick and tired of everything
When I called you last night from Glasgow
All I do is eat and sleep and sing
Wishing every show was the last show (wishing every show was the last show)

So imagine I was glad to hear you're coming (glad to hear you're coming)
Suddenly I feel all right
(And suddenly it's gonna be)
And it's gonna be so different
When I'm on the stage tonight

Tonight the super trouper lights are gonna find me
Shining like the sun (sup-p-per troup-p-per)
Smiling, having fun (sup-p-per troup-p-per)
Feeling like a number one
Tonight the super trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue (sup-p-per troup-p-per)
Like I always do (sup-p-per troup-p-per)
'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you

Facing twenty thousand of your friends
How can anyone be so lonely
Part of a success that never ends
Still I'm thinking about you only (still I'm thinking about you only)

There are moments when I think I'm going crazy (think I'm going crazy)
But it's gonna be alright 
(You'll soon be changing everything)
Everything will be so different
When I'm on the stage tonight

Tonight the super trouper lights are gonna find me
Shining like the sun (sup-p-per troup-p-per)
Smiling, having fun (sup-p-per troup-p-per)
Feeling like a number one
Tonight the super trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue (sup-p-per troup-p-per)
Like I always do (sup-p-per troup-p-per)
'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you

So I'll be there when you arrive
The sight of you will prove to me I'm still alive
And when you take me in your arms
And hold me tight
I know it's gonna mean so much tonight

Tonight the super trouper lights are gonna find me
Shining like the sun (sup-p-per troup-p-per)
Smiling, having fun (sup-p-per troup-p-per)
Feeling like a number one
Tonight the super trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue (sup-p-per troup-p-per)
Like I always do (sup-p-per troup-p-per)
'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you

Lyrics: 
Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner
Sometimes I feel like My only friend
Is the city I live in, The City of Angels
Lonely as I am together we cry

I drive on her streets 'cause she's my companion
I walk through her hills 'cause she knows who I am
She sees my good deeds and she kisses me windy
Well, I never worry, now that is a lie

I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love, take me all the way
I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love take me all the way

Yeah, yeah yeah

It's hard to believe that there's nobody out there
It's hard to believe that I'm all alone
At least I have her love
The city, she loves me
Lonely as I am together we cry

I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love take me all the way
I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love take me all the way

Yeah, yeah yeah
Oh, no, no, no, yeah yeah
Love me, I say, yeah yeah
One time

(Under the bridge downtown)
Is where I drew some blood
(Under the bridge downtown)
I could not get enough
(Under the bridge downtown)
Forgot about my love
(Under the bridge downtown)
I gave my life away, yeah
Yeah yeah
Oh, no, no no no, yeah yeah
Oh no, I said oh, yeah yeah
Here I stay

Their lineup consisted of brothers Barry, Robin, and Maurice Gibb. The trio were successful for most of their decades of recording music, but they had two distinct periods of exceptional success: as a popular music act in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and as prominent performers of the disco music era in the mid-to-late 1970s. The group sang recognisable three-part tight harmonies; Robin's clear vibrato lead vocals were a hallmark of their earlier hits, while Barry's R&B falsetto became their signature sound during the mid-to-late 1970s and 1980s. The Bee Gees wrote all of their own hits, as well as writing and producing several major hits for other artists.

Born on the Isle of Man to English parents, the Gibb brothers lived in Chorlton, Manchester, England, until the late 1950s. There, in 1955, they formed the Rattlesnakes. The family then moved to Redcliffe, in Queensland, Australia, and then to Cribb Island. After achieving their first chart success in Australia as the Bee Gees with ""Spicks and Specks"" (their 12th single), they returned to the UK in January 1967, when producer Robert Stigwood began promoting them to a worldwide audience.

The Bee Gees have sold more than 220 million records worldwide, making them one of the world's best-selling artists of all time. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997; the presenter of the award to ""Britain's first family of harmony"" was Brian Wilson, historical leader of The Beach Boys, another ""family act"" featuring three harmonising brothers. The Bee Gees' Hall of Fame citation says, ""Only Elvis Presley, the Beatles, Michael Jackson, Garth Brooks and Paul McCartney have outsold the Bee Gees.""

Following Maurice's death in January 2003, at the age of 53, Barry and Robin retired the group's name after 45 years of activity. In 2009, Robin announced that he and Barry had agreed the Bee Gees would re-form and perform again. Robin died in May 2012, aged 62, after a prolonged struggle with cancer and other health problems, leaving Barry as the only surviving member of the group's final line-up.",0.384,1813.0,album,https://open.spotify.com/artist/1LZEQNv7sE11VDY3SdxQeN,0.423,182000.0,False,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWJWWHCFPbE,Bee Gees' 1st,"2,854.4",1.327,6.0,1963–20032009–2012,United Kingdom Australia[238][239],120 million,Pop / disco,1963,74.7 million

LYRICS
One man comes in the name of love
One man to come and go.
One man comes he to justify
One man to overthrow.

In the name of love
What more in the name of love.
In the name of love
What more in the name of love.

One man caught on a barbed wire fence
One man he resist
One boy washed up on an empty beach
One boy never will be kissed

In the name of love
One more in the name of love.
In the name of love
One more in the name of love.

In the evening, April four
A shot rings out in the Memphis sky.
Free at last, they took your life
They could not take your pride.

In the name of love
What more in the name of love.
In the name of love
What more in the name of love.

In the name of love
What more in the name of love.
In the name of love
What more in the name of love.

In the name of love
What more in the name of love.
In the name of love
What more in the name of love.",0.378,1041.0,single,https://open.spotify.com/artist/51Blml2LZPmy7TTiAg47vQ,0.551,237743.0,True,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thmcVMobt0s,Pride (In The Name Of Love) [Songs Of Surrender],"2,130.8",0.708,5.0,1976–present,Ireland,150 million,Rock,1980,114.6 million

Lyrics:

I need you boo, (oh)
I gotta see you boo (hey)
And the heart's all over the world tonight,
Said the heart's all over the world tonight

Hey! Little mama,
Ooh, you're a stunner
Hot little figure,
Yes, you're a winner
And I'm so glad to be yours,
You're a class all your own
And
Oh, little cutie
When you talk to me
I swear the whole world stops
You're my sweetheart
And I'm so glad that you're mine
You are one of a kind and...

You mean to me
What I mean to you and
Together baby,
There is nothing we won't do.
'Cause if I got you,
I don't need money,
I don't need cars,
Girl, you're my all.
And...""

Lyrics:

You're a good soldier
Choosing your battles
Pick yourself up
And dust yourself off
Get back in the saddle

You're on the front line
Everyone's watching
You know it's serious
We're getting closer
This isn't over

The pressure's on
You feel it
But you got it all
Believe it

When you fall get up, oh oh
If you fall get up, eh eh
Tsamina mina zangalewa
'Cause this is Africa

Tsamina mina, eh eh
Waka waka, eh eh
Tsamina mina zangalewa
This time for Africa""

About the The Razor's Edge:
AC/DC cracked the seal on the '90s with one of the best riffs of their career. That would be ""Thunderstruck,"" the opening track on The Razors Edge. In addition to ""Thunderstruck,"" the band brought out ""Moneytalks,"" probably the closest they ever came to writing a pop song. Then there was ""Are You Ready"" - one of their fiercest calls to action. The gritty edge and booming chants on this album were a welcome reminder for a new generation that pure, unadulterated rock 'n' roll was alive and well.

Lyrics:
[Intro]
Thunder, ah
Thunder, ah
Thunder, ah
Thunder, ah
Thunder, ah
Thunder, ah
Thunder, ah
Thunder, ah
Thunder, ah
Thunder, ah

[Verse 1]
I was caught
In the middle of a railroad track (Thunder)
I looked 'round
And I knew there was no turning back (Thunder)
My mind raced
And I thought, what could I do? (Thunder)
And I knew
There was no help, no help from you (Thunder)
Sound of the drums
Beating in my heart
The thunder of guns
Tore me apart

[Chorus]
You've been - thunderstruck

[Verse 2]
Went down the highway
Broke the limit, we hit the town
Went through to Texas
Yeah, Texas, and we had some fun
We met some girls
Some dancers who gave a good time
Broke all the rules, played all the fools
Yeah-yeah, they, they, they blew our minds

[Pre-Chorus]
I was shaking at the knees
Could I come again please?
Yeah, the ladies were too kind

[Chorus]
You've been - thunderstruck, thunderstruck
Yeah-yeah-yeah, thunderstruck
Oh, thunderstruck
Yeah

[Bridge 1]
I was shaking at the knees
Could I come again please?
Yow

[Solo]

[Chorus]
Thunderstruck, thunderstruck
Yeah-yeah-yeah, thunderstruck
Thunderstruck, yeah, yeah, yeah
Said

[Bridge 2]
Yeah, it's alright
We're doing fine
Yeah, it's alright
We're doing fine, so fine

[Chorus]
Thunderstruck, yeah-yeah-yeah
Thunderstruck, thunderstruck, thunderstruck
Whoa, baby, baby (Thunderstruck)
You've been thunderstruck, thunderstruck
Thunderstruck, thunderstruck
You've been thunderstruck

The Rolling Stones performing ""You Can’t Always Get What You Want"" from The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus

Recorded before a live audience in London in 1968, The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus was originally conceived as a BBC-TV special. Directed by Michael Lindsay-Hogg, it centers on the original line up of The Rolling Stones -- Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Brian Jones, Charlie Watts, Bill Wyman (with Nicky Hopkins and Rocky Dijon) -- who serves as both the show’s hosts and featured attraction. For the first time in front of an audience, “The World’s Greatest Rock and Roll Band” performs six Stones classics. The program also includes extraordinary performances by The Who, Jethro Tull, Taj Mahal, Marianne Faithfull, Yoko Ono, and The Dirty Mac. A ‘supergroup’ before the term had even been coined, the band was comprised of Eric Clapton (lead guitar), Keith Richards (bass), Mitch Mitchell of The Jimi Hendrix Experience (drums), and John Lennon on guitar and vocals.

LYRICS:
It ain't my fault
So don't blame me
I swear I just came here to unwind and have one drink
The way it looks (Ooh)
Ain't what you think
This Cabernet has a way of vanishin' on me
 
(Hey) There's a hole in the bottle
Leakin' all this wine
It's already empty and it ain't even suppertime
Honey no I don't miss him
In fact, it slipped my mind
There's a hole in the bottle of wine
 
(Shania)
I keep my cool
I play by all the rules
I swear ten minutes ago that bottle was full
And I won't cry
About love gone wrong
Cause tears would water down this ruby red I'm sippin' on
 
There's a hole in the bottle (There's a hole)
Leakin' all this wine (Leakin' all this wine)
It's already empty and it ain't even suppertime (And it ain't even suppertime)
Honey no I don't miss him
In fact, it slipped my mind
There's a hole in the bottle of wine
 
Let's go!
Alright
Look, it's our prerogative
To have a little fun?
Right?
Right!
Ooh, just look at that hole in the bottle
I'm gonna go get us another one
You go, girl
 
I went and got a new one (New one)
Cause the other one was broken (Oh broke)
Now this one's halfway gone
And it's barely even open
 
There's a hole in the bottle (Hole in the bottle)
Leakin' all this wine (In the bottle)
It's already empty and it ain't even suppertime (It ain't even suppertime)
Honey no I don't miss him (Oh, I don't miss him)
In fact, it slipped my mind
There's a hole in the bottle of wine (Hole in the bottle)
 
You may ask me where it's goin'
But I can't even find
The hole in the bottle of wine

Lyrics:
Well it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
Ifin' you don't know by now
An' it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
It'll never do some how
When your rooster crows at the break a dawn
Look out your window and I'll be gone
You're the reason I'm trav'lin' on
Don't think twice, it's all right
And it ain't no use in a-turnin' on your light, babe
The light I never knowed
An' it ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe
I'm on the dark side of the road
But I wish there was somethin' you would do or say
To try and make me change my mind and stay
We never did too much talkin' anyway
But don't think twice, it's all right
No it ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal
Like you never done before
And it ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal
I can't hear ya any more
I'm a-thinkin' and a-wond'rin' wallkin' way down the road
I once loved a woman, a child I am told
I give her my heart but she wanted my soul
But don't think twice, it's all right
So long honey babe
Where I'm bound, I can't tell
Goodbye is too good a word, babe
So I just say fare thee well
I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind
You could have done better but I don't mind
You just kinda wasted my precious time
But don't think twice, it's all right

Due November 10 via Craft Recordings, the remastered album will be available in a variety of formats, the most extensive of which is the Deluxe Anniversary Edition, which will feature the album in its entirety mixed in Dolby Atmos.
 
The album (plus bonus track “Photograph,” featuring Natalie Merchant) was remixed in Dolby Atmos by Automatic’s original producer, Scott Litt, and engineer, Clif Norrell. This technology delivers a leap forward from surround sound with expansive, flowing audio that immerses the listener far beyond what stereo can offer. It transports the listener inside the recording studio with multi-dimensional audio – evoking a time when listening to music was an active, transformative experience, and reigniting the emotion you felt when you first heard the album in 1992.  R.E.M.’s Automatic For The People is the first album to be commercially released in this expressive, breathtaking format.
In addition, the 4-disc Deluxe Edition will offer a wealth of previously unreleased material. The band selected 20 never-before-heard demos from the LP’s sessions, including the fully-realized, unreleased track “Mike’s Pop Song” and the oft-mused about song, “Devil Rides Backwards.”
 
“Mike’s Pop Song” is available NOW as an instant grat track with preorder of the reissue.

Lyrics:

Easy lover
She'll get a hold on you believe it
Like no other
Before you know it you'll be on your knees
She's an easy lover
She'll take your heart but you won't feel it
She's like no other
And I'm just trying to make you see

She's the kind of girl you dream of
Dream of keeping hold of
You'd better forget it
You'll never get it
She will play around and leave you
Leave you and deceive you
Better forget it
Oh you'll regret it",0.923,18223.0,album,https://open.spotify.com/artist/4lxfqrEsLX6N1N4OCSkILp,0.74,305867.0,True,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkRKT6T0QLg,Chinese Wall (Expanded Edition),"1,277.6",0.368,2.0,"1980–2011, 2015–present",United Kingdom,150 million,Rock / progressive rock / adult contemporary,1981,99.4 million

He was noted for his powerful, wide-ranging voice and theatrical live shows. He is on the list of best-selling music artists. His Bat Out of Hell trilogy — Bat Out of Hell (1977), Bat Out of Hell II: Back into Hell (1993), and Bat Out of Hell III: The Monster Is Loose (2006) — has sold more than 65 million albums worldwide.The first album stayed on the charts for over nine years, still sells an estimated 200,000 copies annually, and is on the list of best-selling albums.
After the commercial success of Bat Out of Hell and Bat Out of Hell II: Back Into Hell, and earning a Grammy Award for Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance for the song ""I'd Do Anything for Love"", Aday nevertheless experienced some difficulty establishing a steady career within the United States.The key to this success was his popularity in Europe, especially in the United Kingdom and Ireland, with him receiving the 1994 Brit Award in the United Kingdom for best-selling album and single. He appeared in the 1997 film Spice World and he ranked 23rd for the number of weeks spent on the UK charts in 2006. He ranks 96th on VH1's ""100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock"".

Aday appeared in over 50 films and television shows, sometimes as himself or as characters resembling his stage persona. His film roles include Eddie in The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975) and Robert Paulsen in Fight Club (1999). His early stage work included dual roles in the original Broadway theatre cast of The Rocky Horror Show. He also appeared in the musical Hair, both on and Off-Broadway.

The Rocky Horror Picture Show is a 1975 musical comedy horror film by 20th Century Fox, produced by Lou Adler and Michael White and directed by Jim Sharman. The screenplay was written by Sharman and actor Richard O'Brien, who is also a member of the cast. The film is based on the 1973 musical stage production The Rocky Horror Show, with music, book, and lyrics by O'Brien. The production is a parody tribute to the science fiction and horror B movies of the 1930s through to the early 1960s. Along with O'Brien, the film stars Tim Curry, Susan Sarandon, and Barry Bostwick and is narrated by Charles Gray with cast members from the original Royal Court Theatre, Roxy Theatre, and Belasco Theatre productions including Nell Campbell and Patricia Quinn.
The story centres on a young engaged couple whose car breaks down in the rain near a castle where they seek a telephone to call for help. The castle or country home is occupied by strangers in elaborate costumes celebrating an annual convention. They discover the head of the house is Dr. Frank N. Furter, an apparently mad scientist who actually is an alien transvestite from the planet Transsexual in the galaxy of Transylvania, who creates a living muscle man named Rocky in his laboratory.
The film was shot in the United Kingdom at Bray Studios and on location at an old country estate named Oakley Court, best known for its earlier use by Hammer Film Productions. A number of props and set pieces were reused from the Hammer horror films. Although the film is both a parody of and tribute to many kitsch science fiction and horror films, costume designer Sue Blane conducted no research for her designs. Blane has claimed that her creations for the film directly affected the development of punk rock fashion trends such as torn fishnet stockings and colourfully-dyed hair.
Initial reception was extremely negative, but it soon became a hit as a midnight movie when audiences began participating with the film at the Waverly Theater in New York City in 1976. Audience members returned to the cinemas frequently and talked back to the screen and began dressing as the characters, spawning similar performance groups across the United States. At almost the same time, fans in costume at the King's Court Theater in Pittsburgh began performing alongside the film. This ""shadow cast"" mimed the actions on screen above and behind them, while lip-syncing their character's lines.
Still in limited release in 2022, some 46 years after its premiere, it is the longest-running theatrical release in film history. In many cities live amateur shadow-casts act out the film as it is being shown and heavily draw upon a tradition of audience participation",0.821,51.0,compilation,https://open.spotify.com/artist/7dnB1wSxbYa8CejeVg98hz,0.48,181773.0,False,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C6YLVWGDo0,Best Of,508.1,0.193,1.0,1968–2022,United States,100 million,Rock / hard rock,1977,46.6 million

Lyrics:

I have climbed the highest mountains
I have run through the fields
Only to be with you
Only to be with you.

I have run, I have crawled
I have scaled these city walls
These city walls
Only to be with you.

But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for.
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for.

I have kissed honey lips
Felt the healing in her finger tips
It burned like fire
(I was) burning inside her.

I have spoke with the tongue of angels
I have held the hand of a devil
It was warm in the night
I was cold as a stone.

But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for.
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for.

I believe in the Kingdom Come
Then all the colours will bleed into one
Bleed into one.
But yes, I'm still running.

You broke the bonds
And you loosed the chains
Carried the cross of my shame
Oh my shame, you know I believe it.

But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for.
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for.

But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for.

[Chorus]:
Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus
Right down Santa Claus Lane
He's got a bag that's filled with toys
For boys and girls again

Hear those sleigh bells jingle jangle
What a beautiful sight

Got a Black Magic Woman
Got a Black Magic Woman
I've got a Black Magic Woman
Got me so blind, I can't see
That she's a Black Magic Woman
She's trying to make a Devil outta me

Written by Barry, Robin and Maurice Gibb the song  is supposedly about someone who has done or said something horribly wrong, which results in feelings of social alienation. Others have described it as quite spiritual and could in fact be dealing with the Christian savior himself. Robin Gibb talked in 2009 about ""I Started a Joke"": ""This is a very spiritual song.

""Only Time"" Lyrics:

Who can say where the road goes
Where the day flows, only time
And who can say if your love grows
As your heart chose, only time

Who can say why your heart sighs
As your love flies, only time
And who can say why your heart cries
When your love lies, only time

Who can say when the roads meet
That love might be in your heart
And who can say when the day sleeps
If the night keeps all your heart
Night keeps all your heart

Who can say if your love grows
As your heart chose
- Only time
And who can say where the road goes
Where the day flows, only time

Who knows? Only time

Lyrics: 
Baby we can talk all night
But that ain't getting us nowhere
I told you everything I possibly can
There's nothing left inside of here

And maybe you can cry all night
But that'll never change the way I feel
The snow is really piling up outside
I wish you wouldn't make me leave here

I poured it on and I poured it out
I tried to show you just how much I care
I'm tired of words and I'm too hoarse to shout
But you've been cold to me so long
I'm crying icicles instead of tears

Lyrics:
Oh, holy night, the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error, pining
Till He appeared and the soul felt it's worth

A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn'
Fall on your knees, oh, hear the Angels' voices
Oh, night divine, oh, night when Christ was born
Oh, night divine, oh, night, oh night divine

A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn'
Fall on your knees, oh, hear, hear the Angels' voices
Oh, night divine, yeah, oh, night when Christ was born
Oh, night divine, oh, night, oh night divine

Oh, night divine
Oh, night divine
Oh, night divine

On a last chance power drive
Everybody's out on the run tonight
But there's no place left to hide
Together, Wendy, we can live with the sadness
I'll love you with all the madness in my soul
Oh, someday girl, I don't know when
We're gonna get to that place
Where we really want to go, and we'll walk in the sun
But till then, tramps like us
Baby, we were born to run

Lyrics: 

It was a hot summer night
and the beach was burning.
There was fog crawling over the sand.
When I listen to your heart
I hear the whole world turning.
I see the shooting stars falling
through your trembling hands. 

And then you took the words right out of my mouth.
Oh it must have been while you were kissing me.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
And I swear it's true,
I was just about to say I love you.
And then you took the words right out of my mouth.
Oh it must have been while you were kissing me.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
And I swear it's true,
I was just about to say I love you.

Lyrics: 
As I was going over the Cork and Kerry mountains
I saw Captain Farrell and his money he was counting
I first produced my pistol and then produced my rapier
I said stand and deliver or the devil, he may take you
I took all of his money and it was a pretty penny
I took all of his money, yeah, and I brought it home to Molly
She swore that she would love me, no never would she leave me
But the devil take that woman, yeah, for you know she tricked me easy

Musha ring dum a doo dum a da
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-o

Being drunk and weary I went to Molly's chamber
Taking money with me but I never knew the danger
For about six or maybe seven in walked Captain Farrell
I jumped up, fired off my pistols and I shot him with both barrels, yeah

Musha ring dum a doo dum a da
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-o
Yeah-ah, whiskey in the jar-o
Yeah, yeah, yeah, woah
Yeah, yeah

Now some men like the fishing and some men like the fowling
And some men like to hear, to hear cannon ball a roaring
Me? I like sleeping specially in my Molly's chamber
But here I am in prison, here I am with a ball and chain, yeah

Musha ring dum a doo dum a da, yeah, yeah
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
Whiskey in the jar-o, yeah
Whiskey in the jar-o, yeah

Musha ring dum a doo dum a da
Musha ring dum a doo dum a da
Hey, musha ring dum a doo dum a da

Lyrics:
You belong among the wildflowers
You belong in a boat out at sea
Sail away, kill off the hours
You belong somewhere you feel free

Run away, find you a lover
Go away somewhere all bright and new
I have seen no other
Who compares with you

You belong among the wildflowers
You belong in a boat out at sea
You belong with your love on your arm
You belong somewhere you feel free

Run away, go find a lover
Run away, let your heart be your guide
You deserve the deepest of cover
You belong in that home by and by

You belong among the wildflowers
You belong somewhere close to me
Far away from your trouble and worry
You belong somewhere you feel free
You belong somewhere you feel free

Lyrics:
I made it through the wilderness
Somehow I made it through
Didn't know how lost I was until I found you
I was beat, incomplete, I'd been had
I was sad and blue, but you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel shiny and new

Like a virgin
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
When your heart beats next to mine

Gonna give you all my love, boy
My fear is fading fast
Been saving it all for you, 'cause only love can last
You're so fine and you're mine
Make me strong, yeah, you make me bold
Oh, your love thawed out
Yeah, your love thawed out what was scared and cold

Like a virgin (hey)
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
With your heartbeat next to mine

You're so fine and you're mine
I'll be yours 'til the end of time
'Cause you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel I've nothing to hide

Like a virgin (hey)
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
With your heartbeat next to mine

Like a virgin
Like a virgin
Feels so good inside
When you hold me, and your heart beats, and you love me

Ooh, baby yeah
Can't you hear my heart beat for the very first time?

Lyrics:
Pistol shots ring out in the barroom night
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall
She sees the bartender in a pool of blood
Cries out, ""My God, they killed them all!""
Here comes the story of the Hurricane
The man the authorities came to blame
For somethin' that he never done
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world
Three bodies lyin' there does Patty see
And another man named Bello, movin' around mysteriously
""I didn't do it, "" he says, and he throws up his hands
""I was only robbin' the register, I hope you understand
I saw them leavin', "" he says, and he stops
""One of us had better call up the cops.""
And so Patty calls the cops
And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashin'
In the hot New Jersey night
Meanwhile, far away in another part of town
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are drivin' around
Number one contender for the middleweight crown
Had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road
Just like the time before and the time before that
In Paterson that's just the way things go
If you're black you might as well not show up on the street
'Less you want to draw the heat
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowlin' around
He said, ""I saw two men runnin' out, they looked like middleweights
They jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates.""
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head
Cop said, ""Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead""
So they took him to the infirmary
And though this man could hardly see
They told him that he could identify the guilty men
Four in the mornin' and they haul Rubin in
Take him to the hospital and they bring him upstairs
The wounded man looks up through his one dyin' eye
Says, ""Wha'd you bring him in here for? He ain't the guy!""
Yes, here's the story of the Hurricane
The man the authorities came to blame
For somethin' that he never done
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world
Four months later, the ghettos are in flame
Rubin's in South America, fightin' for his name
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
And the cops are puttin' the screws to him, lookin' for somebody to blame
""Remember that murder that happened in a bar?""
""Remember you said you saw the getaway car?""
""You think you'd like to play ball with the law?""
""Think it might-a been that fighter that you saw runnin' that night?""
""Don't forget that you are white.""
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, ""I'm really not sure.""
Cops said, ""A poor boy like you could use a break
We got you for the motel job and we're talkin' to your friend Bello
Now you don't wanta have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow
You'll be doin' society a favor
That sonofabitch is brave and gettin' braver
We want to put his ass in stir
We want to pin this triple murder on him
He ain't no Gentleman Jim.""

Lyrics:
'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood
When blackness was a virtue the road was full of mud
I came in from the wilderness, a creature void of form
Come in, she said
I'll give ya shelter from the storm
And if I pass this way again, you can rest assured
I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word
In a world of steel-eyed death, and men who are fighting to be warm
Come in, she said
I'll give ya shelter from the storm
Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm
Come in, she said
I'll give ya shelter from the storm
I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail
Poisoned in the bushes an' blown out on the trail
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn
Come in, she said
I'll give ya shelter from the storm
Suddenly I turned around and she was standin' there
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns
Come in, she said
I'll give ya shelter from the storm
Now there's a wall between us, somethin' there's been lost
I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed
Just to think that it all began on an uneventful morn
Come in, she said
I'll give ya shelter from the storm
Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount
But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn
Come in, she said
I'll give ya shelter from the storm
I've heard newborn babies wailin' like a mournin' dove
And old men with broken teeth stranded without love
Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn
Come in, she said
I'll give ya shelter from the storm
In a little hilltop village, they gambled for my clothes
I bargained for salvation and she gave me a lethal dose
I offered up my innocence I got repaid with scorn
Come in, she said
I'll give ya shelter from the storm
Well, I'm livin' in a foreign country but I'm bound to cross the line
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born
Come in, she said
I'll give ya shelter from the storm

It started when we were younger, you were mine (my boo)
Now another brother's taken over, but it's still in your eyes (my boo)
Even though we used to argue, it's alright (my boo)
I know we haven't seen each other in a while
But you will always be my boo
I was in love with you when we were younger, you were mine (my boo)
And I see it from time to time, I still feel like (my boo)
And I can see it no matter how I try to hide (my boo)And even though there's another man who's in my life
You will always be my boo

Lyric:

Look into my eyes - you will see
What you mean to me
Search your heart - search your soul
And when you find me there you'll search no more
Don't tell me it's not worth tryin' for
You can't tell me it's not worth dyin' for
You know it's true
Everything I do - I do it for you

Look into my heart - you will FIND
There's nothin' there to hide
Take me as I am - take my life
I would give it ALL I would sacrifice
Don't tell me it's not worth fightin' for
I can't help it there's nothin' I want more
Ya know it's true
Everything I do - I do it for you

There's no love - like your love
And no other - could give more love
There's nowhere - unless you're there
All the time - all the way

Don't tell me it's not worth tryin' for
I can't help it there's nothin' I want more
I would fight for you - I'd lie for you
Walk the wire for you - Ya I'd die for you

Ya know it's true
Everything I do - I do it for you

Lyrics:
I cannot take this anymore
Saying everything I've said before
All these words they make no sense
I find bliss in ignorance
Less I hear, the less you say
You'll find that out anyway

Just like before

Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
I'm about to break

I find the answers aren't so clear
Wish I could find a way to disappear
All these thoughts they make no sense
I find bliss in ignorance
Nothing seems to go away
Over and over again

Just like before

Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
I'm about to break
Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to
Break!

Shut up when I'm talking to you!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up when I'm talking to you!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
I'm about to break!

Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
I'm about to break
Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to
Break!

Lyrics:
I am a little bit of loneliness
A little bit of disregard
Handful of complaints, but I can't help the fact
That everyone can see these scars
I am what I want you to want
What I want you to feel
But it's like no matter what I do
I can't convince you to just believe this is real

So I let go, watching you
Turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I'm not
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I've got

I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored

I am a little bit insecure
A little unconfident
'Cause you don't understand, I do what I can
But sometimes, I don't make sense
I am what you never wanna say
But I've never had a doubt
It's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you
For once, just to hear me out

So I let go, watching you
Turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I'm not
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I've got

I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored

No, hear me out now
You're gonna listen to me, like it or not
Right now, hear me out now
You're gonna listen to me, like it or not
Right now
I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored

I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored

I can't feel
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
Time won't heal
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored

Lyrics
The kiss of Venus
Has got me on the go
She scored a bullseye
In the early morning glow
Early morning glow

(Verse 1)
Have ya 
Read the paper 
People talkin 
About which side they’re takin 
And if you know then baby what’s your take on it 
Does it make you want to leave 
Cuz I could look the other way for ya 

Reflected mountains in a lake
Is this too much to take?
Asleep or wide awake?
And if the world begins to shake
Will something have to break?
Or would we stay awake?

The kiss of Venus
Has got me on the go
She scored a bullseye
In the early morning glow
Early morning glow

(Verse 2) 
Have ya read the paper 
people talkin 
Without no education 
Go to college 
Go find your major 
Realize you’re minor in the scheme of everything

#U2 #One #Remastered

Lyrics: 

Is it getting better, or do you feel the same?
Will it make it easier on you, now you got someone to blame?
You say one love, one life, when it's one need in the night.
One love, we get to share it
Leaves you baby if you don't care for it.

Did I disappoint you or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love and you want me to go without.
Well, it's too late tonight to drag the past out into the light.
We're one, but we're not the same.
We get to carry each other, carry each other... one

Have you come here for forgiveness,
Have you come to raise the dead
Have you come here to play Jesus to the lepers in your head
Did I ask too much, more than a lot
You gave me nothing, now it's all I got.
We're one, but we're not the same.
Well, we hurt each other, then we do it again.

You say love is a temple, love a higher law
Love is a temple, love the higher law.
You ask me to enter, but then you make me crawl
And I can't be holding on to what you got, when all you got is hurt.

One love, one blood, one life, you got to do what you should.
One life with each other: sisters, brothers.
One life, but we're not the same.
We get to carry each other, carry each other.

Lyrics: 
Scar tissue that I wish you saw
Sarcastic mister know-it-all
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
'Cause with the birds I'll share

With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'

Push me up against the wall
Young Kentucky girl in a push-up bra
Ah, fallin' all
Over myself
To lick your heart
And taste your health, 'cause

With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely view

Blood loss in a bathroom stall
A southern girl with a scarlet drawl
I wave good-bye to Ma and Pa
'Cause with the birds I'll share

With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'

Soft spoken with a broken jaw
Step outside but not to brawl and
Autumn's sweet we
Call it fall
I'll make it to the moon
If I have to crawl and

With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely view

Scar tissue that I wish you saw
Sarcastic mister know-it-all
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
'Cause with the birds I'll share

With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely view

Lyrics:
In this farewell
There's no blood, there's no alibi
'Cause I've drawn regret
From the truth of a thousand lies
So let mercy come and wash away

What I've done
I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done

Put to rest what you thought of me
While I clean this slate
With the hands of uncertainty
So let mercy come and wash away

What I've done
I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done

For what I've done
I start again
And whatever pain may come
Today this ends
I'm forgiving

What I've done
I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done

(Na-na na na)
(Na-na na na)
(Na-na na na)
What I've done
(Na-na na na)
(Na-na na na)
(Na-na na na)
Forgiving what I've done

Lyrics: 

[Verse 1]
She was walking in the street, looked up and noticed
He was nameless, he was homeless
She asked him his name and told him what hers was
He gave her a story 'bout life
With a glint in his eye and a corner of a smile
One conversation, a simple moment
The things that change us if we notice
When we look up sometimes

[Pre-Chorus]
They said I would never make it
But I was built to break the mold
The only dream that I've been chasing is my own

[Chorus]
So I sing a song for the hustlers trading at the bus stop
Single mothers waiting on a check to come
Young teachers, student doctors
Sons on the front line knowing they don't get to run
This goes out to the underdog
Keep on keeping at what you love
You'll find that someday soon enough
You will rise up, rise up, yeah

[Verse 2]
She's riding in a taxi back to the kitchen
Talking to the driver 'bout his wife and his children
On the run from a country where they put you in prison
For being a woman and speaking your mind
She looked in his eyes in the mirror and he smiled
One conversation, a single moment
The things that change us if we notice
When we look up sometimes

[Pre-Chorus]
They said I would never make it
But I was built to break the mold
The only dream that I've been chasing is my own

[Chorus]
So I sing a song for the hustlers trading at the bus stop

Lyrics:
Papa, I know you're going to be upset
'Cause I was always your little girl
But you should know by now, I'm not a baby
You always taught me right from wrong
I need your help, daddy, please be strong
I may be young at heart, but I know what I'm saying

The one you warned me all about
The one you said I could do without
We're in an awful mess
And I don't mean maybe
Please

Papa don't preach
I'm in trouble, deep
Papa don't preach
I've been losing sleep
But I made up my mind
I'm keeping my baby
Ooh, I'm gonna keep my baby, mmm

He says that he's going to marry me
We can raise a little family
Maybe we'll be all right
It's a sacrifice

But my friends keep telling me to give it up
Saying I'm too young, I ought to live it up
What I need right now is some good advice
Please

Papa don't preach
I'm in trouble, deep
Papa don't preach
I've been losing sleep
But I made up my mind
I'm keeping my baby
Ooh, I'm gonna keep my baby, aah, ooh

Daddy, daddy, if you could only see
Just how good he's been treating me
You'd give us your blessing right now
'Cause we are in love
We are in love
So please

Daddy, daddy
Daddy, daddy

Daddy, daddy, if you could only see
Just how good he's been treating me
You'd give us your blessing right now
'Cause we are in love
We are in love
So please

Papa don't preach
Papa don't preach
Papa don't preach
Papa don't preach

Papa don't preach
Papa don't preach

Papa don't preach
I'm in trouble, deep
Papa don't preach
I've been losing sleep
But I made up my mind
I'm keeping my baby
Ooh, I'm gonna keep my baby

Papa don't preach
Don't you stop loving me, daddy
I know I'm gonna keep my baby, ooh

Lyrics:
She can kill with a smile
She can wound with her eyes
She can ruin your faith with her casual lies
And she only reveals what she wants you to see
She hides like a child
But she's always a woman to me

She can lead you to love
She can take you or leave you
She can ask for the truth
But she'll never believe
And she'll take what you give her as long as it's free
Yeah, she steals like a thief
But she's always a woman to me

Lyrics

That's all I wanted:
Something special, something sacred
In your eyes.
For just one moment
To be bold and naked
At your side.

Sometimes I think that you never
Understand me (understand me).
Maybe this time is forever.
Say it can be, whoa.

That's all you wanted:
Something special, someone sacred
In your life.
Just for one moment
To be warm and naked
At my side.

Sometimes I think that you never
Understand me (understand me).
But something tells me together
We'd be happy, oh, oh.

(baby)
I will be your father figure.
(oh, baby)
Put your tiny hand in mine.
(I'd love to)
I will be your preacher teacher.
(be your daddy)
Anything you have in mind.
(it would make me)
I will be your father figure.
(very happy)
I have had enough of crime.
(please let me)
I will be the one who loves you
'Til the end of time (of time).

That's all I wanted,
But sometimes love can be mistaken
For a crime.
That's all I wanted:
Just to see my baby's
Blue eyes shine.

This time I think that my lover
Understands me (understands me).
Please
If we have faith in each other
Then we can be
Strong.

(baby)
I will be your father figure.
Put your tiny hand in mine.
(my baby)
I will be your preacher teacher.
Anything you have in mind.
I will be your father figure.
I have had enough of crime.
I will be the one who loves you
'Til the end of time.

If you are the desert
I'll be the sea.
If you ever hunger 
Hunger for me.
Whatever you ask for
That's what I'll be.

So when you remember the ones who have lied,
Who said that they cared,
But then laughed as you cried,
Beautiful darling,
Don't think of me.

Because all I ever wanted...
It's in your eyes, baby, baby.
And love can't lie.
No.

Greet me with the eyes of a child.
My love is always tellin' me so.
Heaven is a kiss and a smile.
Just hold on, hold on.
And I won't let you go, my baby.

I will be your father figure.
Put your tiny hand in mine.
I will be your preacher teacher.
Anything you have in mind, baby.
I will be your father figure.
And I have had enough of crime.
I will be the one who loves you—
So, I am gonna love you—
'Til the end of time.

I will be your father.
(I will be your...)
I will be your preacher.
(...father)
I will be your father.
I'll be your daddy, whoa.
I will be the one who loves you

Lyrics:
You know when you give your love away
It opens your heart,
Everything is new.
And you know time will always find a way
To let your heart believe it's true.

You know love is everything you say;
A whisper, a word,
Promises you give.
You feel it in the heartbeat of the day.
You know this is the way love is.

[Chorus:]
Amarantine...
Amarantine...
Amarantine...
Love is.
Love is.
Love...

You know love may sometimes make you cry,
So let the tears go,
They will flow away,
For you know love will always let you fly
...How far a heart can fly away!

[Chorus]

You know when love's shining in your eyes
It may be the stars
Fallen from above.
And you know love is with you when you rise,
For night and day belong to love.

Lyrics:

Man, it's a hot one
Like seven inches from the midday sun
Well, I hear you whisper and the words melt everyone
But you stay so cool

My muñequita,
My Spanish Harlem Mona Lisa
You're my reason for reason
The step in my groove, yeah.

And it's just like the ocean under the moon
Well, that's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of loving that can be so smooth, yeah.
Gimme your heart, make it real
Or else forget about it""",0.923,32884.0,album,https://open.spotify.com/artist/6GI52t8N5F02MxU0g5U69P,0.609,294987.0,True,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Whgn_iE5uc,Supernatural (Legacy Edition),"1,490.9",0.57,3.0,1966–present,United States,100 million,Rock,1969,62.8 million

Wave your hands if your not with the man
Can I kick it?

I got

You got

We got everybody
I've got the gift
Gonna stick it in the goal
It's time to move your body

Babylon back in business
Can I get a witness?
Every girl, every man
Houston, do you hear me?
Ground control, can you feel me?
Need permission to land
I don't wanna rock, DJ
But your making me feel so nice
When's it gonna stop, DJ?
Cos you're keepin' me up all night

Singin' in the classes
Music for your masses
Give no head
No backstage passes
Have a proper giggle
I'll be quite polite
But when I rock the mic
I rock the mic
(Right)
You got no love, then you're with the wrong man
It's time to move your body
If you can't get a girl
But your best friend can
It's time to move your body

I don't wanna be sleazy
Baby just tease me
Got no family planned

Lyrics:

I look and stare so deep in your eyes,
I touch on you more and more every time,
When you leave I'm begging you not to go,
Call your name two or three times in a row,
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain,
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame.
'Cause I know I don't understand,
Just how your love can do what no one else can.

Got me looking so crazy right now, your love's
Got me looking so crazy right now (in love)
Got me looking so crazy right now, your touch
Got me looking so crazy right now (your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now, your kiss
Got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy in love's,
Got me looking, got me looking so crazy in love.",0.77,66334.0,album,https://open.spotify.com/artist/6vWDO969PvNqNYHIOW5v0m,0.646,236133.0,True,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViwtNLUqkMY,Dangerously In Love,"14,681.4",2.947,37.0,1997–present,United States,200 million160 million,R&B / pop,2002,226.5 million

Lyrics:
Anthony works in the grocery store
Savin' his pennies for someday
Mama Leone left a note on the door
She said, Sonny, move out to the country
Workin' too hard can give you
A heart attack (ack)
You oughta know by now (oughta know)
Who needs a house out in Hackensack
Is that what you get with your money
It seems such a waste of time
If that's what it's all about
Mama if that's movin' up
Then I'm movin' out
I'm movin' out
Sergeant O'Leary is walkin' the beat
At night he becomes a bartender
He works at Mister Cacciatore's down
On Sullivan Street
Across from the medical center
He's tradin' in his Chevy for a Cadillac
You oughta know by now
And if he can't drive
With a broken back
At least he can polish the fenders
It seems such a waste of time
If that's what it's all about
Mama if that's movin' up
Then I'm movin' out
I'm movin' out
You should never argue with a crazy mind (mmm)
You oughta know by now
You can pay Uncle Sam with the overtime
Is that all you get for your money
If that's what you have in mind
If that's what you're all about
Good luck movin' up
'Cause I'm moving out
I'm moving out
I'm moving out

I'm outta time, and all I got is four minutes
Fikki fikki, four minutes, aye
I'm outta time, and all I got is four minutes
Fikki fikki, four minutes, aye
I'm outta time, and all I got is four minutes (Four, four)
Fikki fikki, four minutes, aye

Fikki fikki, ow, ow, c'mon
Ah. yeah, ha, breakdown, c'mon

Hey, uh, c'mon, Madonna

C'mon, boy
I've been waiting for somebody to pick up my stroll
Well, don't waste time
Give me a sign, tell me how you wanna roll, mmm
I want somebody to speed it up for me
Then take it down slow
There's enough room for both
Well, I can handle that
You just gotta show me where it's at
Are you ready to go?
Are you ready to go?

If you want it, you already got it
If you thought it, it better be what you want
If you feel it, it must be real just
Say the word, and I'mma give you what you want

The time is waiting
(We only got four minutes to save the world)
No hesitating
Grab a boy (Then grab a girl)
Time is waiting
(We only got four minutes to save the world)
No hesitating
(We only got four minutes, heh, a-four minutes)

So keep it up, keep it up
Don't be a pri (Hey) ma donna, uh
You gotta get 'em on, hop
(Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock, tick tock)
That's right, keep it up, keep it up
Don't be a pri (Hey) ma donna, uh
You gotta get 'em on, hop
(Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock, tick tock)

Sometimes I think what I need is a ""you"" intervention, yeah
And you know I can tell that you like it
And that it's good, by the way that you move, oh hey
The road to hell is paved with good intentions, yeah
But if I die tonight, at least I can say I did what I wanted to do
Tell me, how 'bout you?

[Madonna and Justin Timberlake:]
If you want it, you already got it
If you thought it, it better be what you want
If you feel it, it must be real just
Say the word, and I'mma give you what you want

[Madonna (Justin Timberlake):]
The time is waiting
(We only got four minutes to save the world)
No hesitating
Grab a boy (Then grab a girl)
Time is waiting
(We only got four minutes to save the world)
No hesitating
(We only got four minutes, heh, a-four minutes)

So keep it up, keep it up
Don't be a pri (Hey!) ma donna, uh
You gotta get 'em on, hop
(Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock, tick tock)
That's right, keep it up, keep it up
Don't be a pri (Hey!) ma donna, uh
You gotta get 'em on, hop
(Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock, tick tock)

Lyrics: 
How long, how long
Will I slide?
Well separate my side
I don’t
I don’t believe it’s bad
Slittin' my throat
It’s all I ever

I heard your voice through a photograph
I thought it up
And brought up the past
Once you know you can never go back

I gotta take it on the otherside

Well centuries are what it meant to me
A cemetery where I marry the sea
The stranger things that never change my mind

I gotta take it on the otherside
Take it on the otherside
Take it on
Take it on

How long, how long
Will I slide?
A-separate my side
I don’t
I don’t believe it’s bad
A-slittin' my throat
It’s all I ever

Pour my life into a paper cup
The ashtray's full
And I’m spillin' my guts
She want to know
Am I still a slut?

I gotta take it on the otherside

A scarlet starlet and she’s in my bed
A candidate for my soul mate bled
Mmm-push the trigger
And I pull the thread

I gotta to take it on the otherside
Take it on the otherside
Take it on
Take it on

[Chorus]
How long, how long
Will I slide?
Separate my side
I don’t
I don’t believe it’s bad
A-slittin' my throat
It’s all I ever

Turn me on
Take me for a hard ride
Burn me out
Leave me on the otherside
I yell and tell it that it’s not my friend
I tear it down, I tear it down
And then it’s born again

How long, how long
Will I slide?
Separate my side
I don’t
I don’t believe it’s bad
A-slittin' my throat
It’s all I ever had

(How long)
I don’t
I don’t believe it’s sad
A-slittin' my throat
It’s all I ever

Lyrics:
Standing in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on, heavy glow
By the way, I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for
Dani, the girl, is singing songs to me
Beneath the marquee, overload

Steak knife, card shark
Con job, boot cut
Skin that flick, she's such a little DJ
To get there quick by street but not the freeway
Turn that trick to make a little leeway
Beat that nic, but not the way that we play
Dogtown, blood bath
Rib cage, soft tail

Standing in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on, heavy glow
By the way, I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for

Black jack,dope dick
Pawn shop, quick pick
Kiss that dyke, I know you want to hold one
Not on strike but I'm about to bowl one
Bite that mic, I know you never stole one
Girls that like a story, so I told one
Song bird, main line
Cash back, hard top

Standing in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on, heavy glow
By the way, I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for
Dani, the girl, is singing songs to me
Beneath the marquee, oversold
By the way, I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for

Ooh, ah, guess you never meant it
Ooh, ah, guess you never meant it
Ooh, ah, guess you never meant it
Ooh, ah, guess you never meant it
Ooh, ah, guess you never meant it
Ooh, ah, guess you never meant it
Ooh, ah, guess you never meant it
Ooh, ah

Standing in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on, heavy glow
By the way, I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for
Dani, the girl, is singing songs to me
Beneath the marquee, oversold
By the way, I tried to say
I know you from before

Standing in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on, heavy glow
By the way, I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for

Lyrics: 
Come to decide that the things that I tried were in my life just to get high on. 
When I sit alone, come get a little known 
But I need more than myself this time. 
Step from the road to the sea to the sky, and I do believe that we rely on 
When I lay it on, come get to play it on 
All my life to sacrifice. 

Hey oh... listen what I say oh 
I got your hey oh, now listen what I say oh 

When will I know that I really can't go 
To the well once more - time to decide on. 
Well it's killing me, when will I really see, all that I need to look inside. 
Come to belive that I better not leave before I get my chance to ride, 
Well it's killing me, what do I really need - all that I need to look inside. 

Hey oh... listen what I say oh 
Come back and hey oh, look at what I say oh 

The more I see the less I know 
The more I like to let it go - hey oh, woah... 
Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder where it's so white as snow, 
Finally divided by a word so undecided and there's nowhere to go; 
Inbetween the cover of another perfect wonder and it's so white as snow, 
Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed and there's nowhere to go. 

Ho! 
Went to descend to ammend for a friend of the channels that had broken down. 
Now you bring it up, I'm gonna ring it up - just to hear you sing it out. 
Step from the road to the sea to the sky, and I do belive what we rely on, 
When I lay it on, come get to play it on 
All my life to sacrifice 

Hey oh... listen what I say oh 
I got your hey oh... listen what I say oh 

The more I see, the less I know 
The more I like to let it go - hey oh, woah... 
Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder where it's so white as snow. 
Finally divided by a word so undecided and there's nowhere to go 
Inbetween the cover of another perfect wonder where it's so white as snow 
Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed and there's nowhere to go. 

I said hey hey yeah oh yeah, tell my love now. 
Hey hey yeah oh yeah, tell my love now. 

Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder where it's so white as snow, 
Finaly divided by a word so undecided and there's nowhere to go. 
Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder where it's so white as snow...
Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed and there's nowhere to go. 

I said hey oh yeah oh yeah... tell my love now 
Hey yeah yeah... oh yeah.

#U2 #WhereTheStreetsHaveNoName #Remastered
 
Lyrics:

I wanna run, I want to hide
I wanna tear down the walls
That hold me inside.
I wanna reach out
And touch the flame
Where the streets have no name.

I wanna feel sunlight on my face.
I see the dust-cloud
Disappear without a trace.
I wanna take shelter
From the poison rain
Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name.

We're still building and burning down love
Burning down love.
And when I go there
I go there with you
(It's all I can do).

The city's a flood, and our love turns to rust.
We're beaten and blown by the wind
Trampled in dust.
I'll show you a place
High on a desert plain
Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name.

We're still building and burning down love
Burning down love.
And when I go there
I go there with you
(It's all I can do).",0.724,12747.0,album,https://open.spotify.com/artist/51Blml2LZPmy7TTiAg47vQ,0.49,337506.0,True,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzZWSrr5wFI,The Joshua Tree (Super Deluxe),"2,130.8",0.708,5.0,1976–present,Ireland,150 million,Rock,1980,114.6 million

Lyrics:
Lyrics:
Let me run with you tonight
I’ll take you on a moonlight ride
There’s someone I used to see
But she don’t give a damn for me
 
So let me get to the point, let’s roll another joint
And turn the radio loud, I’m too alone to be proud
You don’t know how it feels
You don’t know how it feels to be me
 
People come, people go
Some grow young, some grow cold
I woke up in between
A memory and a dream

So let’s get to the point, let’s roll another joint
Let’s head on down the road 
To somewhere I gotta go
You don’t know how it feels
You don’t know how it feels to be me
 
My old man was born to rock
He’s still tryin’ to beat the clock
Think of me what you will
I’ve got a little space to fill
 
So let’s get to the point, let’s roll another joint
Let’s head on down the road
To somewhere I gotta go
And you don’t know how it feels
You don’t know how it feels 
You don’t know how it feels to be me
You don’t know how it feels 
No you don’t know how it feels 
You don’t know how it feels to be me

Lyrics:
No I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way
The story goes
You always smile but in your eyes
Your sorrow shows
Yes it shows
No I can't forget tomorrow
When I think of all my sorrow
When I had you there
But then I let you go
And now it's only fair
That I should let you know
What you should know

Lyrics: 
Do you know what's worth fighting for
When it's not worth dying for?
Does it take your breath away
And you feel yourself suffocating?
Does the pain weigh out the pride?
And you look for a place to hide?
Did someone break your heart inside?
You're in ruins

One, twenty-one guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, twenty-one guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
You and I

When you're at the end of the road
And you lost all sense of control
And your thoughts have taken their toll
When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul
Your faith walks on broken glass
And the hangover doesn't pass
Nothing's ever built to last
You're in ruins

One, twenty-one guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, twenty-one guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
You and I

Did you try to live on your own
When you burned down the house and home?
Did you stand too close to the fire
Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone?

When it's time to live and let die
And you can't get another try
Something inside this heart has died
You're in ruins

One, twenty-one guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, twenty-one guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
One, twenty-one guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, twenty-one guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
You and I

Lyrics

I know when to go out
And when to stay in
Get things done
I catch a paper boy
But things don't really change
I'm standing in the wind
But I never wave bye-bye
But I try
I try
There's no sign of life
It's just the power to charm
I'm lying in the rain
But I never wave bye-bye

But I try
I try

Never going to fall for
(Modern Love)
Walks beside me
(Modern Love)
Walks on by
(Modern Love)
Gets me to the Church on Time
(Church on Time)
Terrifies me
(Church on Time)
Makes me party
(Church on Time)
Puts my trust in God and Man
(God and Man)
No confessions!
(God and Man)
No religion
(God and Man)
Don't believe
In Modern Love

It's not really work
It's just the power to charm
I'm still standing in the wind
But I never wave bye bye

But I try
I try

Never going to fall for
(Modern Love)
Walks beside me
(Modern Love)
Walks on by
(Modern Love)
Gets me to the Church on Time
(Church on Time)
Terrifies me
(Church on Time)
Makes me party

About David Bowie:
David Bowie redefined musical genres and the potential of live performance for generations of music lovers. Creating and discarding a variety of personae and restlessly challenging musical boundaries, Bowie released timeless albums including Space Oddity, Hunky Dory, The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust…, Aladdin Sane, Diamond Dogs, Young Americans, Station to Station, ""Heroes,” Let's Dance, Heathen, The Next Day and many more. Blackstar, Bowie’s 28th and final studio album, was released on his 69th birthday, January 8, 2016. David Bowie died on January 10, 2016, two days after the release of Blackstar. His body of work, his influence on the worlds of music, art, fashion, film, theatre and beyond, and his legacy of innovation and reinvention will live forever. 2022 kicks off with Bowie at 75, a celebration of his 75th birthday with the Brilliant Adventure box set, the previously unreleased Toy, the 50th anniversary of Ziggy Stardust and a series of special events.

Chorus:
These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way
These are my confessions
Man, I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give you part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all
Damn near cried when I got that phone call
I'm so throwed, I don't know what to do
But to give you part two of my confessions

Lyrics:
If you're travelin' in the north country fair
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Remember me to one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine
If you go when the snowflakes storm
When the rivers freeze and summer ends
Please see if she's wearing a coat so warm
To keep her from the howlin' winds
Please see for me if her hair hangs long
If it rolls and flows all down her breast
Please see for me if her hair hangs long
For that's the way I remember her best
I'm a-wonderin' if she remembers me at all
Many times I've often prayed
In the darkness of my night
In the brightness of my day
So, if you're travelin' in the north country fair
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Remember me to one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine

Lyrics: 
How will I know if he really loves me?
I say a prayer with every heartbeat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you what you know about these things
How will I know if he's thinking of me?
I try to phone, but I'm too shy (Can't speak)
Falling in love is so bittersweet
This love is strong, why do I feel weak?

All those lonely, lonely times

I'm so sorry I was blind

Lyrics:

Oh, a storm is threat'ning
My very life today
If I don't get some shelter
Oh yeah, I'm gonna fade away

War, children, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
War, children, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away

Ooh, see the fire is sweepin'
Our very street today
Burns like a red coat carpet
Mad bull lost your way

War, children, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
War, children, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away

Rape, murder!
It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away

Rape, murder!
It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away

Rape, murder!
It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away

The flood is threat'ning
My very life today
Gimme, gimme shelter
Or I'm gonna fade away

War, children, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away

I tell you love, sister, it's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away
Kiss away, kiss away

Lyrics

I can't light no more of your darkness
All my pictures seem to fade to black and white
I'm growing tired and time stands still before me
Frozen here on the ladder of my life

It's much to late to save myself from falling
I took a chance and changed your way of fife
But you misread my meaning when i met you
Closed the door and left me blinded by the light

Don't let the sun go down on me
Although i search myself, it's always someone else i see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free
But losing everything is like the sun going down on me""",0.596,34818.0,compilation,https://open.spotify.com/artist/19ra5tSw0tWufvUp8GotLo,0.437,347667.0,True,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsKqMNDoR4o,Love Songs,"2,330.8",1.041,5.0,1981–2016,United Kingdom,100 million,Pop,1984,52.8 million

Lyrics: 
A few stolen moments, is all that we shared
You've got your family, and they need you there
Though I try to resist, being last on your list
But no other man's gonna do
So I'm saving all my love for you

Lyrics:
It starts with one thing
I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me

Will eventually be a memory of a time when
I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

Ever close your eyes
Ever stop and listen
Ever feel alive
And you've nothing missing
You don't need a reason
Let the day go on and on
Let the rain fall down
Everywhere around you
Give into it now
Let the day surround you
You don't need a reason
Let the rain go on and on
What a day
What a day to take to
What a way
What a way
To make it through
What a day
What a day to take to
A wild child
Only take the time
From the helter skelter
Every day you find
Everything's in kilter
You don't need a reason
Let the day go on and on
Every summer sun
Every winter evening
Every spring to come
Every autumn leaving
You don't need a reason
Let it all go on and on
What a day
What a day to take to
What a way
What a way
To make it through
What a day
What a day to take to
A wild child

#EltonJohn #BritneySpears #HoldMeCloser
This stunning dance video for Hold Me Closer, shot in Mexico City by the award winning director Tanu Muino beautifully capturing an immeasurable feeling of intimacy so missing from the world through the turmoil and chaos of recent times.
Tanu said, ""This was an emotional one for me as I grew up with Britney. After seeing ""Slave For You,"" I decided that I wanted to become a video director. Elton John is an icon that I and the world grew up listening to,” On the creative direction, Muino continued, ""Going into this video, I knew there would be a lot of emotional expectations the audience and fans would have. With this responsibility, I had to do something different and unexpected. The dance had to be forward-thinking to raise eyebrows and make Elton and Britney proud. To capture this magic, we shot around all my favorite architectural locations in Mexico City and brought on choreographer Jacob Jonas who does the best contemporary choreography today. Getting the best dancers, crew, and access to some of the most private locations in the world was simple as everyone wanted to work with Elton John and be part of his legacy.""

Lyrics:
(I don’t ever want to fall when I’m this high)
 
I wrote a letter to myself
in the form of a song I can play when the sun shines
I know better than to trust
anything that I say to myself when I’m this high
 
Ay! Ay! Ay! Ay!
(I don’t ever want to fall when I’m this high)
Ay! Ay! Ay! Ay!
(I don’t ever want to fall when I’m this high)
 
I just did an interview with my eyes closed
I just sparked a blunt it looked like pyro
Only comments I see are the bad ones
Only playlists I like are the sad ones
 
I let the medicine in
I know it don’t help in the end
But I got depression again
I had a meeting at 7
I skipped it and slept in and woke up at 7pm
 
I cut my hair
off like I’m Britney
sparkle dust
like a pixie
Wipe my nose
like it’s itchy
I’m tatted up,
I don’t give a fuck
 
Ay! Ay! Ay! Ay!
(I don’t ever want to fall when I’m this high)
Ay! Ay! Ay! Ay!
(I don’t ever want to fall when I’m this high)
 
(LIL WAYNE v.)
 
When I’m this high
When I’m this high
I just looked in the mirror who is this guy
It’s a full moon
Where the good shrooms
I’m too fucking high
Sound like a good school
Higher than Jehovah
High where the heaven’s at
You know Ima get pulled over
Ima need a chauffer
Lean in my soda
So Ima need a shoulder
Why y’all got your noses up
I smell like guns and roses
 
Ay! Ay! Ay! Ay!
(I don’t ever want to fall when I’m this high)
Ay! Ay! Ay! Ay!
(I don’t ever want to fall when I’m this high)
(I don’t ever want to fall when I’m this high)

The pop legend who died on January 10, 2016, would have turned 74 today. That's why we honour him on our home page with his most famous Toppop recording made back in March 1974. 

David Robert Jones OAL (8 January 1947 – 10 January 2016), known professionally as David Bowie, was an English singer-songwriter and actor. A leading figure in the music industry, Bowie is regarded as one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century. He was acclaimed by critics and musicians, particularly for his innovative work during the 1970s. His career was marked by reinvention and visual presentation, and his music and stagecraft had a significant impact on popular music.

During his lifetime, his record sales, estimated at over 100 million records worldwide, made him one of the best-selling music artists of all time. In the UK, he was awarded ten platinum, eleven gold and eight silver album certifications, and released 11 number-one albums. In the US, he received five platinum and nine gold certifications. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996. Rolling Stone named him among the greatest artists in history and – after his death – the ""greatest rock star ever"".

This is the famous video of David Bowie recorded in the TopPop studios in Hilversum the Netherlands, under the direction of Rien van Wijk.
It was broadcast on 4 March 1974. Davis selected this video himself for the DVD 'Best of Bowie' (2004) as he really liked this recording. It was a big hit in the UK (#5)  and the Netherlands (#8).
On the same day David did a press conference in the Amstel Hotel in Amsterdam where he received an Edison award for 'Hunky Dory'

Preorder the 25th anniversary album:  http://found.ee/REM-automatic25-r

R.E.M. is excited to announce the reissue of their landmark album Automatic For The People to commemorate the record's 25th Anniversary. Due November 10 via Craft Recordings, the remastered album will be available in a variety of formats, the most extensive of which is the Deluxe Anniversary Edition, which will feature the album in its entirety mixed in Dolby Atmos.
 
The album (plus bonus track “Photograph,” featuring Natalie Merchant) was remixed in Dolby Atmos by Automatic’s original producer, Scott Litt, and engineer, Clif Norrell. This technology delivers a leap forward from surround sound with expansive, flowing audio that immerses the listener far beyond what stereo can offer. It transports the listener inside the recording studio with multi-dimensional audio – evoking a time when listening to music was an active, transformative experience, and reigniting the emotion you felt when you first heard the album in 1992.  R.E.M.’s Automatic For The People is the first album to be commercially released in this expressive, breathtaking format.
In addition, the 4-disc Deluxe Edition will offer a wealth of previously unreleased material. The band selected 20 never-before-heard demos from the LP’s sessions, including the fully-realized, unreleased track “Mike’s Pop Song” and the oft-mused about song, “Devil Rides Backwards.”
 
“Mike’s Pop Song” is available NOW as an instant grat track with preorder of the reissue.

Lyrics:
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly

Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, baby, night and day
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you

Time goes by so slowly for those who wait
No time to hesitate
Those who run seem to have all the fun
I'm caught up, I don't know what to do

Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
I don't know what to do

Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, baby, night and day
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you
Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, baby, night and day
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you

Ring, ring, ring goes the telephone
The lights are on, but there's no one home
Tick tick tock, it's a quarter to two
And I'm done, I'm hanging up on you

I can't keep on waiting for you
I know that you're still hesitating
Don't cry for me, 'cause I'll find my way
You'll wake up one day, but it'll be too late

Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, baby, night and day
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you
Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, baby, night and day
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you

Every little thing, every little thing
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, waiting for your call
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you

Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly, so slowly
So slowly, so slowly, so slowly
So slowly, so slowly, so slowly
So slowly, so slowly, so slowly
So slowly, so slowly, so slowly, so...
I don't know what to do

Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, baby, night and day
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you
Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, baby, night and day
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you

Every little thing, every little thing
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, waiting for your call
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you

Lyrics: 
New blood joins this Earth and quickly he's subdued
Through constant pained disgrace, the young boy learns their rules
With time the child draws in this whipping boy done wrong
Deprived of all his thoughts, the young man struggles on and on
He's known, ooh, a vow unto his own that never from this day
His will they'll take away, yeah

What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be, never see
Won't see what might have been
What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free, never me
So I dub thee ""Unforgiven""

They dedicate their lives to running all of his
He tries to please them all this bitter man he is
Throughout his life the same, he's battled constantly
This fight he cannot win, a tired man they see no longer cares
The old man then prepares to die regretfully
That old man here is me, yeah

What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be, never see
Won't see what might have been
What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free, never me
So I dub thee ""Unforgiven""

What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be, never see
Won't see what might have been
What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free, never me
So I dub thee ""Unforgiven,"" whoa

Never free, never me
So I dub thee ""Unforgiven""
You labeled me, I'll label you
So I dub thee ""Unforgiven""
Ah, never free, never me
So I dub thee ""Unforgiven""
You labeled me, I'll label you
So I dub thee ""Unforgiven""
Never free, never me
So I dub thee ""Unforgiven""

To really love a woman
To understand her - you gotta know her deep inside
Hear every thought - see every dream
N' give her wings when she wants to fly
Then when you find yourself lyin' helpless in her arms
Ya know ya really love a woman
 
When you love a woman you tell her that she's really wanted
When you love a woman you tell her that she's the one
Cuz she needs somebody to tell her that it's gonna last forever
So tell me have you ever really - really really ever loved....
 
To really love a woman
Let her hold you - til ya know how she needs to be touched
You've gotta breathe her - really taste her
Til you can feel her in your blood
N' when you can see your unborn children in her eyes
Ya know ya really love a woman

When you love a woman you tell her that she's really wanted
When you love a woman you tell her that she's the one
Cuz she needs somebody to tell her that you’ll always be together
So tell me have you ever really - really really ever loved....
 
You got to give her some faith - hold her tight
A little tenderness - gotta treat her right
She will be there for you, takin' good care of you
Ya you really gotta love your woman...

Lyrics:
Life is a mystery
Everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

I hear your voice
It's like an angel sighing
I have no choice
I hear your voice
Feels like flying
I close my eyes
Oh God, I think I'm falling
Out of the sky
I close my eyes
Heaven, help me

When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

Like a child
You whisper softly to me
You're in control
Just like a child
Now I'm dancing
It's like a dream
No end and no beginning
You're here with me
It's like a dream
Let the choir sing

When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

Life is a mystery
Everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

Just like a prayer
Your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me
You are a mystery
Just like a dream
You are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice
Your voice can take me there

Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me

Just like a prayer
Your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me
You are a mystery
Just like a dream
You are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice
Your voice can take me there

Just like a prayer
Your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me
You are a mystery
Just like a dream
You are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice
Your voice can take me there
Your voice can take me there
Like a prayer

Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
It's like a prayer
Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
It's like a prayer
Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
It's like a prayer
Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
It's like a prayer

It started when we were younger, you were mine (my boo)
Now another brother's taken over, but it's still in your eyes (my boo)
Even though we used to argue, it's alright (my boo)
I know we haven't seen each other in a while
But you will always be my boo
I was in love with you when we were younger, you were mine (my boo)
And I see it from time to time, I still feel like (my boo)
And I can see it no matter how I try to hide (my boo)And even though there's another man who's in my life
You will always be my boo

Well  here we are again
I guess it must be fate
We've tried it on our own
But deep inside we've known
We’ll be back to set things straight

I still remember when 
Your kiss was so brand new
And Every memory repeats
Every step I take retreats
Every journey always brings me back to you

Chorus

After all the stops and starts
We keep coming back to these two hearts
Two angels who've been rescued from the fall
After all that we've been through
All comes down to being with you
I guess its meant to be
Forever you and me 
After all

Well love is truly right, this time it's truly right
It lives from year to year
It changes as it goes, and on the way it grows
But it never disappears

Lyrics:
I'll have a blue Christmas without you
I'll be so blue just thinking about you
Decorations of red on our green Christmas tree
Won't be the same dear, if you're not here with me

And when those blue snowflakes start fallin'
That's when those blue memories start callin'
You'll be doin' all right, with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue, blue, blue Christmas

You'll be doin' all right, with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue, blue, blue Christmas

Lyrics:

I was a highwayman
Along the coach roads I did ride
With sword and pistol by my side
Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five
But I am still alive

I'll fly a starship
Across the Universe divide
And when I reach the other side
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
But I will remain
And I'll be back again, and again and again and again and again...

Touched down in the land of the
Delta Blues In the middle of the pouring rain
W.C. Handy - won?t you look down over me
Yeah I got a first class ticket
But I'm as blue as a girl can be

Then I'm walking in Memphis
Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel

Saw the ghost of Elvis
On Union Avenue Followed him up to the gates of Graceland
Then I watched him walk right through
Now security they did not see him
They just hovered
'round his tomb
But there's a pretty little thing
Waiting for the King Down in the Jungle Room

[Chorus]

They've got catfish on the table
They've got gospel in the air
And Reverend Green be glad to see you
When you haven't got a prayer
But boy you've got a prayer in Memphis

Now Gabriel plays piano
Every Friday at the Hollywood
And they brought me down to see him
And they asked me if I would - Do a little number
And I sang with all my might

Lyrics:
Come gather 'round people
Wherever you roam
And admit that the waters
Around you have grown
And accept it that soon
You'll be drenched to the bone.
If your time to you
Is worth savin'
Then you better start swimmin'
Or you'll sink like a stone
For the times they are a-changin'.
Come writers and critics
Who prophesize with your pen
And keep your eyes wide
The chance won't come again
And don't speak too soon
For the wheel's still in spin
And there's no tellin' who
That it's namin'.
For the loser now
Will be later to win
For the times they are a-changin'.
Come senators, congressmen
Please heed the call
Don't stand in the doorway
Don't block up the hall
For he that gets hurt
Will be he who has stalled
There's a battle outside
And it is ragin'.
It'll soon shake your windows
And rattle your walls
For the times they are a-changin'.
Come mothers and fathers
Throughout the land
And don't criticize
What you can't understand
Your sons and your daughters
Are beyond your command
Your old road is
Rapidly agin'.
Please get out of the new one
If you can't lend your hand
For the times they are a-changin'.
The line it is drawn
The curse it is cast
The slow one now
Will later be fast
As the present now
Will later be past
The order is
Rapidly fadin'.
And the first one now
Will later be last
For the times they are a-changin'.

Lyrics: 
Say hey!
Cha

Hear the sound of the falling rain
Coming down like an Armageddon flame (Hey!)
The shame, the ones who died without a name
Hear the dogs howling out of key
To a hymn called ""Faith and Misery"" (Hey!)
And bleed, the company lost the war today

I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
On holiday!

Hear the drum pounding out of time
Another protester has crossed the line (Hey!)
To find the money's on the other side
Can I get another Amen? (Amen!)
There's a flag wrapped around a score of men (Hey!)
A gag, a plastic bag on a monument

I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
On holiday!

Three, four!
""The representative from California has the floor.""
Sieg Heil to the president Gasman
Bombs away is your punishment
Pulverize the Eiffel towers
Who criticize your government
Bang bang goes the broken glass
And kill all the fags that don't agree
Trials by fire, setting fire
Is not a way that's meant for me
Just ‘cause (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Just ‘cause (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Because we're outlaws, yeah!

I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
This is our lives on holiday

Lyrics: 
I walk a lonely road
The only one that I have ever known
Don't know where it goes
But it's home to me, and I walk alone
I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one, and I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk a-

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone

Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah

I'm walking down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the borderline
Of the edge and where I walk alone
Read between the lines
What's fucked up, and everything's all right
Check my vital signs
To know I'm still alive, and I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk a-

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone

Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah
I walk alone, I walk a-

I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one, and I walk a-

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone

Lyrics:
Let me sail, let me sail, let the Orinoco flow
Let me reach, let me beach on the shores of Tripoli
Let me sail, let me sail, let me crash upon your shore
Let me reach, let me beach far beyond the Yellow Sea
Sail away, sail away, sail away
Sail away, sail away, sail away
Sail away, sail away, sail away
Sail away, sail away, sail away
From Bissau to Palau in the shade of Avalon
From Fiji to Tiree and the isles of Ebony
From Peru to Cebu, feel the power of Babylon
From Bali to Cali, far beneath the Coral Sea
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
Sail away, sail away, sail away
Sail away, sail away, sail away
Sail away, sail away, sail away
Sail away, sail away, sail away
From the North to the South, Ebudau unto Khartoum
From the deep sea of clouds to the island of the Moon
Carry me on the waves to the land I've never been
Carry me on the waves to the land I've never seen
We can sail, we can sail with the Orinoco flow
We can sail, we can sail
Sail away, sail away, sail away
We can steer, we can near with Rob Dickins at the wheel
We can sigh, say goodbye, Ross and his dependencies
We can sail, we can sail
Sail away, sail away, sail away
We can sail, we can sail
Sail away, sail away, sail away
Sail away, sail away, sail away
Sail away, sail away, sail away
Sail away, sail away, sail away
Sail away, sail away, sail away

You're toxic, I'm slippin' under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?

#EltonJohn #BritneySpears #HoldMeCloser
This stunning dance video for Hold Me Closer, shot in Mexico City by the award winning director Tanu Muino beautifully capturing an immeasurable feeling of intimacy so missing from the world through the turmoil and chaos of recent times.
Tanu said, ""This was an emotional one for me as I grew up with Britney. After seeing ""Slave For You,"" I decided that I wanted to become a video director. Elton John is an icon that I and the world grew up listening to,” On the creative direction, Muino continued, ""Going into this video, I knew there would be a lot of emotional expectations the audience and fans would have. With this responsibility, I had to do something different and unexpected. The dance had to be forward-thinking to raise eyebrows and make Elton and Britney proud. To capture this magic, we shot around all my favorite architectural locations in Mexico City and brought on choreographer Jacob Jonas who does the best contemporary choreography today. Getting the best dancers, crew, and access to some of the most private locations in the world was simple as everyone wanted to work with Elton John and be part of his legacy.""

Lyrics: 
Well, I heard you crying loud
All the way across town
You've been searching for that someone and it's me out on the prowl
As you sit around feeling sorry for yourself
Well, don't get lonely now
And dry your whining eyes
I'm just roamin' for the moment, sleazin' my backyard, so don't get
So uptight, you've been thinking about ditching me

No time to search the world around
'Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around

Oh, I heard it all before
So don't knock down my door
I'm a loser and a user, so I don't need no accuser
To try and slag me down because I know you're right
So go do what you like
Make sure you do it wise
You may find out that your self-doubt means nothing was ever there
You can't go forcing something if it's just not right

No time to search the world around
'Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around

No time to search the world around
'Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around
When I come around
When I come around
When I come around

Abbey Road presented with new mixes in stereo, 5.1 surround, and Dolby Atmos; expanded with previously unreleased session recordings and demos.
 
Super deluxe 4 disc set, 3 LP deluxe vinyl, 2 CD deluxe, limited edition picture disc, CD, LP, digital and streaming. Available everywhere September 27, 2019.
 
On August 8, 1969, the world’s most famous band stepped out from London’s EMI Recording Studios to stride, single-file, across the black and white stripes of Abbey Road’s nearby zebra crossing. With photographer Iain Macmillan balanced on a stepladder and one policeman stopping the street’s light traffic, The Beatles crossed back and forth three times, led by John Lennon, followed by Ringo Starr, Paul McCartney, and George Harrison. Just six photos were taken, with the fifth selected as the cover shot for The Beatles’ penultimate studio album, Abbey Road, named after the tree-lined street in which the studios are located.
 
Released September 26, 1969, Abbey Road was not The Beatles’ final album, as Let It Be followed in 1970, but it was the last one John, Paul, George, and Ringo recorded together as a band. The Beatles celebrated Abbey Road’s anniversary with a suite of beautifully presented packages released worldwide on September 27, 2019 by Apple Corps Ltd./Capitol/UMe. Now available, the album’s 17 tracks are newly mixed by producer Giles Martin and mix engineer Sam Okell in stereo, high res stereo, 5.1 surround, and Dolby Atmos, accompanied by 23 session recordings and demos, most of which are previously unreleased.

Lyrics:
Like a river flows
Surely to the sea

The dog in the video belonged to the studio owner, but liked BA and followed him during his stay there. Mutt and BA also wrote ""All For Love"" around the same time as this song.

Lyrics:

It still feels like our first night together
Feels like the first kiss and it's gettin' better...
No one can better this
I’m still holdin' on and you're still the one
The first time our eyes met - it's the same feelin...
Only feels much stronger - i wanna love ya longer
You still turn the fire on...

So if you're feelin' lonely..don't 
You're the only one i'd ever want
I only wanna make it good 
So if i love ya - a little more than i should

Please forgive me - I know not what I do
Please forgive me - I can't stop loving you
Don't deny me - this pain I'm going through
Please forgive me - if I need you like I do
Please believe me - every word I say is true
Please forgive me - I can't stop loving you

Still feels like our best times are together
Feels like the first touch - we’re still getting closer baby
Can't get close enough
Still holding on - you're still number one
I remember the smell of your skin
I remember everything - I remember all your moves
I remember you - yeah
I remember the nights, you know I still do

Chorus

The one thing I'm sure of - is the way we make love
The one thing I depend on - is for us to stay strong
With every word and every breath I'm praying
That's why I'm saying…

Lyrics

Well I guess it would be nice
If I could touch your body
I know not everybody
Has got a body like you

But I've got to think twice
Before I give my heart away
And I know all the games you play
Because I play them too

Oh but I
Need some time off from that emotion
Time to pick my heart up off the floor
Oh when that love comes down
Without devotion
Well it takes a strong man baby
But I'm showing you the door

‘Cause I gotta have faith
I gotta have faith
‘Cause I gotta have faith, faith
‘Cause I gotta have faith, faith, faith

Baby,
I know you're asking me to stay
Say please, please, please don't go away
You say I'm giving you the blues
Maybe
You mean every word you say
Can't help but think of yesterday
And another who tied me down to loverboy rules

Before this river
Becomes an ocean
Before you throw my heart back on the floor
Oh oh baby I reconsider
My foolish notion
Well I need someone to hold me
But I'll wait for something more

Yes I've gotta have faith…
Mmm, I gotta have faith
‘Cause I gotta have faith, faith, faith
I gotta have faith-a-faith-a-faith

Before this river
Becomes an ocean
Before you throw my heart back on the floor
Oh oh baby I reconsider
My foolish notion
Well I need someone to hold me
But I'll wait for something more

Cause I gotta have faith
Mmm I gotta have faith

Lyrics: 
Don't wanna be an American idiot
Don't want a nation under the new mania
And can you hear the sound of hysteria?
The subliminal mind-fuck America

Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alien nation
Where everything isn't meant to be okay
Television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones who're meant to follow
For that's enough to argue

Well, maybe I'm the faggot, America
I'm not a part of a redneck agenda
Now everybody do the propaganda
And sing along to the age of paranoia

Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alien nation
Where everything isn't meant to be okay
Television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones who're meant to follow
For that's enough to argue

Don't wanna be an American idiot
One nation controlled by the media
Information age of hysteria
It's calling out to idiot America

Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alien nation
Where everything isn't meant to be okay
Television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones who're meant to follow
For that's enough to argue

Lyrics:
Si es cuestion de confesar
No se preparar cafe
Y no entiendo de futbol
Creo que alguna vez fui infiel
Juego mal hasta el parques
Y jamas uso reloj
Y para ser mas franca nadie
Piensa en ti como lo hago yo
Aunque te de lo mismo
Si es cuestion de confesar
Nunca duermo antes de diez
Ni me baño los domingos
La verdad es que tambien
Lloro una vez al mes
Sobre todo cuando hay frio
Conmigo nada es facil
Ya debes saber
Me conoces bien
Y sin ti todo es tan aburrido
El cielo esta cansado ya de ver
La lluvia caer
Y cada dia que pasa es uno mas
Parecido a ayer
No encuentro forma alguna de
Olvidarte porque
Seguir amandote es inevitable
Siempre supe que es mejor
Cuando hayque hablar de dos
Empezar por uno mismo""

Lyrics:
Tonight we ride, right or wrong
Tonight we sail, on a radio song
Rescue me, should I go down
If I stay too long in trouble town

Oh, yeah, you wreck me, baby
Yeah, you break me in two
But you move me, honey
Yes, you do

Now and again, I get the feeling
Well, if I don't win, I'm a-gonna break even
Rescue me, should I go wrong
If I dig too deep, if I stay too long

Oh, yeah, you wreck me, baby
Yeah, you break me in two
But you move me, honey
Yes, you do

I'll be the boy in the corduroy pants
You'll be the girl at the high school dance
Run with me, wherever I go
And just play dumb, whatever you know

Oh, yeah, you wreck me, baby
Yeah, you break me in two
But you move me, honey
Yes, you do
You wreck me, baby
Yeah, you break me in two
Oh, but you move me, honey
Ah, yes, you do

The “Don't Go Breaking My Heart” video was shot all in one take with a three-camera setup by Mike Mansfield. During the instrumental section, Elton attempts to teach Kiki a version of the “hand jive”, a 1950s dance that would resurge in popularity with the release of the film Grease.

Written by Rod Temperton
Produced by Quincy Jones for Quincy Jones Productions
From the album Off the Wall, released August 10, 1979
Released as a single November 3, 1979

THE SHORT FILM
Director: Bruce Gowers
Primary Production Location: Los Angeles, California

Although all of Michael Jackson's music videos are referred to as short films, the short films for Off the Wall, Michael's first solo album for Epic Records, are more classic ""music videos,"" as they are performance clips rather than scripted stories.  Michael's short film for ""Rock With You"" was the second of the three short films produced for recordings from that album. The single reached No. 1 in the United States in 1980, topping Billboard's Hot 100 and Hot R&B Singles charts and reaching No. 4 on Billboard's Year-End Hot 100 chart that same year.

""Rock With You"" was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America on February 14, 1980, and Platinum of February 14, 1989. The song was ranked No. 82 on Rolling Stone and MTV's list of the 100 Greatest Pop Songs in 2000. In his 1988 memoir Moonwalk, Michael called ""Rock With You,"" written by Rod Temperton, ""the sort of thing I was aiming for"" in creating an album to his vision.

The short film featured Michael performing the song on a plain stage in a sequined jumpsuit and matching boots, a set of shimmering lasers illuminating his outfit from behind. Director Bruce Gowers praised Michael as ""an absolute professional"" in an interview with Rolling Stone. In 2014, the magazine would rank ""Rock With You"" No. 6 on a list of Michael Jackson's 20 Greatest Videos.

Lyrics
I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing, will drive them away
We can beat them, just for one day
We can be heroes, just for one day


And you, you can be mean
And I, I'll drink all the time
'Cause we're lovers, and that is a fact
Yes we're lovers, and that is that


Though nothing, will keep us together
We could steal time, just for one day
We can be heroes, forever and ever
What d'you say?

I, I wish you could swim
Like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim


Though nothing, nothing will keep us together
We can beat them, forever and ever
Oh we can be heroes, just for one day


I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing, will drive them away
We can be heroes, just for one day
We can be us, just for one day

I, I can remember (I remember)
Standing, by the wall (by the wall)
And the guns, shot above our heads (over our heads)
And we kissed, as though nothing could fall (nothing could fall)


And the shame, was on the other side
Oh we can beat them, forever and ever
Then we could be heroes, just for one day
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
We can be heroes, just for one day
We can be heroes


We're nothing, and nothing will help us
Maybe we're lying, then you better not stay
But we could be safer, just for one day
Oh-oh-oh-ohh, oh-oh-oh-ohh, just for one day

About David Bowie:
David Bowie redefined musical genres and the potential of live performance for generations of music lovers. Creating and discarding a variety of personae and restlessly challenging musical boundaries, Bowie released timeless albums including Space Oddity, Hunky Dory, The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust…, Aladdin Sane, Diamond Dogs, Young Americans, Station to Station, ""Heroes,” Let's Dance, Heathen, The Next Day and many more. Blackstar, Bowie’s 28th and final studio album, was released on his 69th birthday, January 8, 2016. David Bowie died on January 10, 2016, two days after the release of Blackstar. His body of work, his influence on the worlds of music, art, fashion, film, theatre and beyond, and his legacy of innovation and reinvention will live forever. 2022 kicks off with Bowie at 75, a celebration of his 75th birthday with the Brilliant Adventure box set, the previously unreleased Toy, the 50th anniversary of Ziggy Stardust and a series of special events.

Lyrics: 
This is what a woman wants
Any man of mine better be proud of me
Even when I'm ugly, he still better love me
And I can be late for a date that's fine
But he better be on time

Any man of mine'll say it fits just right
When last year's dress is just a little too tight
And anything I do or say better be okay
When I have a bad hair day
And if I change my mind
A million times
I want to hear him say
Yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah), yeah, I like it that way
Any man of mine better walk the line
Better show me a teasin' squeezin' pleasin' kinda time
I need a man who knows, how the story goes
He's gotta be a heartbeatin' fire breathin'
Breathtakin' earthquakin' kind
Any man of mine

Well any man of mine better disagree
When I say another woman's lookin' better than me
And when I cook him dinner and I burn it black
He better say, mm, I like it like that, yeah
And if I change my mind
A million times
I want to hear him say
Yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah), yeah I like it that way
Any man of mine better walk the line
Better show me a teasin' squeezin' pleasin' kinda time
I need a man who knows, how the story goes
He's gotta be a heartbeatin' fire breathin'
Breathtakin' earthquakin' kind
Any man of mine

Lyrics: 
How will I know if he really loves me?
I say a prayer with every heartbeat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you what you know about these things
How will I know if he's thinking of me?
I try to phone, but I'm too shy (Can't speak)
Falling in love is so bittersweet
This love is strong, why do I feel weak?

Lyrics

(Gotta get up to get down)
(Gotta get up to get down)
(Ooh ooh, baby baby)

Looking for some education
Made my way into the night
All that bullshit conversation
Well baby can't you read the signs?

I won't bore you with the details baby
I don't even wanna waste your time
Let's just say that maybe
You could help to ease my mind
Baby, I ain't Mr. Right

But if you're looking for fastlove
If that's love in your eyes
It's more than enough
Had some bad love
Some fastlove is all that I've got on my mind

(Ooh ooh, baby baby)
Ooh, yeah yeah
(Ooh ooh, baby baby)
What's there to think about baby?
(Ooh ooh, baby baby)
Hey baby, oh yeah
(Ooh ooh, baby baby)

Looking for some affirmation
Made my way into the sun
My friends got their ladies
And they're all having babies
But I just wanna have some fun

I won't bore you with the details baby
Gotta get there in your own sweet time
Let's just say that maybe
You could help to ease my mind
Baby, I ain't Mr. Right

But if you're looking for fastlove
If that's love in your eyes
It's more than enough
Had some bad love
Some fastlove is all that I've got on my mind
Get yourself some lessons in love

So close
I can taste it now baby
So close

In the absence of security
Made my way into the night
Stupid cupid keeps on calling me
But I see nothing in his eyes
I miss my baby, oh yeah
I miss my baby, tonight
So why don't we make a little room
In my BMW babe
Searchin' for some peace of mind
Hey, I'll help you find it
I do believe that we are practicing the same religion

Oh you really oughta get up now
That's right
Oh you really oughta get up

Lyrics: 
I'm having trouble trying to sleep
I'm counting sheep but running out
As time ticks by
still I try
No rest for crosstops in my mind
On my own... here we go

My eyes feel like they're gonna bleed
Dried up and bulging out my skull
My mouth is dry
My face is numb
Fucked up and spun out in my room
On my own... here we go

My mind is set on overdrive
The clock is laughing in my face
A crooked spine
My senses dulled
Passed the point of delirium
On my own... here we go

My eyes feel like they're gonna bleed
Dried up and bulging out my skull
My mouth is dry
My face is numb
Fucked up and spun out in my room
On my own... here we go

Jaded:

Somebody keep my balance
I think I'm falling off
Into a state of regression

The expiration date
Rapidly coming up
It's leaving me behind to rank

Always move forward
Going ""straight"" will get you nowhere

There is no progress
Evolution killed it all
I found my place in nowhere

I'm taking one step sideways
Leading with my crutch
Got a fucked up equilibrium

Count down from 9 to 5
Hooray! We're gonna die!
Blessed into our distinction

Always move forward
Going ""straight"" will get you nowhere

There is no progress
Evolution killed it all
I found my place in nowhere

Always move forward
Going ""straight"" will get you nowhere

There is no progress
Evolution killed it all
I found my place in nowhere
In nowhere
In nowhere

This piece was originally released on February 27th, 1995 on album Greatest Hits. Almost two years later ""Secret Garden"" gained a lot of popularity thanks to ""Jerry Maguire"" - Cameron Crowe's sport drama. I recommend both the movie (with Tom Cruise, Renée Zellweger, Cuba Gooding jr., Jonathan Lipnicki, Ray Mohr, Kelly Preston) and great collection of songs appreciated by filmmakers (The Who, Neil Young, Elvis Presley, Paul McCartney, Nancy Wilson, Bob Dylan and others). Lyrics below.

--------------------------------------------------------------

PL: Znana i lubiana piosenka Bruce'a Springsteena, ""Secret Garden"", część swojej popularności zawdzięcza filmowi ""Jerry Maguire"". Utwór pierwotnie pojawił się w albumie Greatest Hits wydanym 27 lutego 1995 roku. Prawie dwa lata później ""Secret Garden"" stał się częścią ścieżki dźwiękowej filmu. Oba te utwory zainspirowały mnie do stworzenia własnego teledysku. Polecam zarówno świetny dramat Camerona Crowe'a, jak i znakomity soundtrack. Na płycie znajdują się utwory m.in. The Who, Elvisa Presleya, Neila Younga, Paula McCartneya, Nancy Wilson i Boba Dylana.

--------------------------------------------------------------

LYRICS (słowa):

She'll let you in her house,
If you come knockin' late at night.
She'll let you in her mind,
If the words you say are right.
If you pay the price,
She'll let you deep inside,
But there's a secret garden she hides.
She'll let you in her car,
To go drivin' 'round.
She'll let you into the parts of herself,
That'll bring you down.
She'll let you in her heart,
If you got a hammer and a vise,
But into her secret garden, don't think twice.

You've gone a million miles,
How far'd you get,
To that place where you can't remember,
And you can't forget.

She'll lead you down a path.
There'll be tenderness in the air.
She'll let you come just far enough,
So you know she's really there.
Then she'll look at you and smile,
And her eyes will say,
She's got a secret garden,
Where everything you want,
Where everything you need,
Will always stay,
A million miles away.

About the album:
Years of musical knowledge and understanding had passed between Angus and Malcolm Young by the time High Voltage announced the arrival of a new Australian take on rock. With Bon Scott on board, this 1976 American release reduced rock 'n' roll down to rhythm, riffs, and raunch.

Lyrics:
Some boys kiss me, some boys hug me
I think they're OK
If they don't give me proper credit, I just walk away
They can beg and they can plead
But they can't see the light, that's right
'Cause the boy with the cold hard cash is always Mister Right

'Cause we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

Some boys romance, some boys slow dance
That's all right with me
If they can't raise my interest, then I have to let them be
Some boys try, and some boys lie
But I don't let them play, no way
Only boys that save their pennies make my rainy day

'Cause we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

Living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

Living in a material world (material)
Living in a material world
Living in a material world (material)
Living in a material world

Boys may come, and boys may go
And that's all right, you see
Experience has made me rich, and now they're after me

'Cause everybody's living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

Living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

A material, a material, a material, a material world

Living in a material world (material)
Living in a material world
Living in a material world (material)
Living in a material world

Living in a material world (material)
Living in a material world
Living in a material world (material)
Living in a material world

Lyrics:
Where's the fire, what's the hurry about?
You better cool it off before you burn it out
You got so much to do and only
So many hours in a day (Ay)

But you know that when the truth is told
That you can get what you want
Or you can just get old
You're gonna kick off before you even get halfway through (Oooh)
When will you realize... Vienna waits for you?

{Don't worry, I won't hurt you
I only want you to have some fun}
I was dreamin' when I wrote this, forgive me if it goes astray
But when I woke up this mornin', could've sworn it was judgment day
The sky was all purple, there were people runnin' everywhere
Tryin' to run from the destruction, you know I didn't even care
Say say two thousand zero zero party over, oops, out of time
So tonight I'm gonna party like it's nineteen ninety-nine
I was dreamin' when I wrote this, so sue me if I go too fast
But life is just a party and parties weren't meant to last
War is all around us, my mind says prepare to fight
So if I gotta die I'm gonna listen to my body tonight
Yeah hey, they say two thousand zero zero party over, oops, out of time
So tonight I'm gonna party like it's nineteen ninety-nine

Lyrics:

Tell me just what you want me to be
One kiss and boom you're the only one for me
So please tell me why don't you come around no more
Cause right now I'm crying outside the door of your candy store

It just takes a little bit of this
A little bit of that
It started with a kiss
Now we're up to bat
A little bit of laughs
A little bit of pain
I'm telling you, my babe
It's all in the game of love",0.929,10449.0,album,https://open.spotify.com/artist/6GI52t8N5F02MxU0g5U69P,0.59,254467.0,True,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKLnmMacEB4,Shaman,"1,490.9",0.57,3.0,1966–present,United States,100 million,Rock,1969,62.8 million

And I heard as it were the noise of thunder 
One of the four beasts saying come and see and I saw
And behold a white horse

There's a man going around taking names 
And he decides who to free and who to blame
Everybody won't be treated all the same
There'll be a golden ladder reaching down
When the Man comes around

The hairs on your arm will stand up 
At the terror in each sip and in each sup
Will you partake of that last offered cup?
Or disappear into the potter's ground
When the Man comes around

Hear the trumpets, hear the pipers
One hundred million angels singing
Multitudes are marching to the big kettledrum
Voices calling, voices crying
Some are born and some are dying
It's Alpha and Omega's kingdom come

And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
The virgins are all trimming their wicks
The whirlwind is in the thorn tree
It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks

Till Armageddon no shalam, no shalom
Then the father hen will call his chickens home
The wise man will bow down before the throne
And at His feet they'll cast their golden crowns
When the Man comes around

Whoever is unjust let him be unjust still
Whoever is righteous let him be righteous still
Whoever is filthy let him be filthy still
Listen to the words long written down
When the Man comes around

Hear the trumpets, hear the pipers 
One hundred million angels singing
Multitudes are marching to the big kettledrum
Voices calling and voices crying
Some are born and some are dying
It's Alpha and Omega's kingdom come

And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
The virgins are all trimming their wicks
The whirlwind is in the thorn tree
It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks

In measured hundred weight and penney pound
When the Man comes around.

Close (Spoken part)
And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts
And I looked and behold, a pale horse

Lyrics:
Come out Virginia, don't let me me wait
You Catholic girls start much too late
But sooner or later it comes down to fate
I might as well be the one
They showed you a statue and told you to pray
They built you a temple and locked you away
But they never told you the price that you pay
For things that you might have done...
Only the good die young

You might have heard I run with a dangerous crowd
We ain't too pretty, we ain't too proud
We might be laughing a bit too loud
But that never hurt no one
Come on Virginia show me a sign
Send up a signal I'll throw you the line
The stained-glass curtain you're hiding behind
Never lets in the sun
Darling, only the good die young

Chorus:
I walked the avenue, 'til my legs felt like stone
I heard the voices of friends vanished and gone
At night I could hear the blood in my veins
It was just as black and whispering as the rain
On the Streets of Philadelphia

Ain't no angel gonna greet me
It's just you and I, my friend
My clothes don't fit me no more
I walked a thousand miles
Just to slip this skin

Written by Bryan Adams and Jim Vallance


We waited all through the year
For the day to appear
When we could be together in harmony

You know the time will come 
Peace on earth for everyone
And we can live forever in a world where we are free
Let it shine for you and me

There's something about Christmas time
Something about Christmas time
That makes you wish it was Christmas everyday
To see the joy in the children's eyes
The way that the old folks smile
Says that Christmas will never go away

We're all as one tonight
Makes no difference if you're black or white
'cause we can sing together in harmony

I know it's not too late
The world would be a better place
If we can keep the spirit more than one day in the year
Send a message loud and clear

It's the time of year when everyone's together
We'll celebrate here on Christmas day
When the ones you love are there
You can feel the magic in the air
You know it's everywhere


There's something about Christmas time
Something about Christmas time
That makes you wish it was Christmas everyday
To see the joy in the children's eyes
The way that the old folks smile
Says that Christmas will never go away
Please tell me Christmas will never go away

Lyrics:
If you're travelin' in the north country fair
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Remember me to one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine
If you go when the snowflakes storm
When the rivers freeze and summer ends
Please see if she's wearing a coat so warm
To keep her from the howlin' winds
Please see for me if her hair hangs long
If it rolls and flows all down her breast
Please see for me if her hair hangs long
For that's the way I remember her best
I'm a-wonderin' if she remembers me at all
Many times I've often prayed
In the darkness of my night
In the brightness of my day
So, if you're travelin' in the north country fair
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Remember me to one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine

Lyrics: 
Psychic spies from China try to steal your mind's elation
An' little girls from Sweden dream of silver screen quotation
And if you want these kind of dreams, it's Californication
It's the edge of the world and all of Western civilization
The sun may rise in the east at least it settled in a final location
It's understood that Hollywood sells Californication

Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging
Celebrity skin, is this your chin or is that war you're waging?
Firstborn unicorn
Hardcore soft porn

Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication

Marry me, girl, be my fairy to the world, be my very own constellation
A teenage bride with a baby inside getting high on information
And buy me a star on the boulevard, it's Californication
Space may be the final frontier but it's made in a Hollywood basement
And Cobain, can you hear the spheres singing songs off Station to Station?
And Alderaan's not far away, it's Californication

Born and raised by those who praise control of population
Well, everybody's been there and I don't mean no vacation
First born unicorn
Hardcore soft porn

Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication

Destruction leads to a very rough road but it also breeds creation
And earthquakes are to a girl's guitar they're just another good vibration
And tidal waves couldn't save the world from Californication

Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging
Sicker than the rest, there is no test but this is what you're craving
First born unicorn
Hardcore soft porn

Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication

Lyrics:
Can't stop, addicted to the shindig
Chop Top, he says I'm gonna win big
Choose not a life of imitation
Distant cousin to the reservation

Defunct, the pistol that you pay for
This punk, the feelin' that you stay for
In time I want to be your best friend
East side love is living on the West End

Knocked out, but, boy, you better come to 
Don't die, you know, the truth as some do
Go write your message on the pavement
Burn so bright, I wonder what the wave meant

White heat is screamin' in the jungle
Complete the motion if you stumble
Go ask the dust for any answers 
Come back strong with fifty belly dancers

The world I love, the tears I drop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Ever wonder if it's all for you?
The world I love, the trains I hop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Come and tell me when it's time to

Sweetheart is bleeding in the snow cone
So smart, she's leadin' me to ozone
Music, the great communicator
Use two sticks to make it in the nature

I'll get you into penetration
The gender of a generation
The birth of every other nation
Worth your weight, the gold of meditation

This chapter's gonna be a close one
Smoke rings, I know you're gonna blow one
All on a spaceship, persevering
Use my hands for everything but steering

Can't stop the spirits when they need you
Mop tops are happy when they feed you
J. Butterfly is in the treetop
Birds that blow the meaning into bebop

The world I love, the tears I drop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Ever wonder if it's all for you?
The world I love, the trains I hop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Come and tell me when it's time to

Wait a minute, I'm passin' out
Win or lose, just like you
Far more shockin'
Than anything I ever knew
How 'bout you?
Ten more reasons why I need
Somebody new, just like you
Far more shockin'
Than anything I ever knew
Right on cue

Can't stop, addicted to the shindig
Chop Top, he says I'm gonna win big
Choose not a life of imitation
Distant cousin to the reservation

Defunct, the pistol that you pay for
This punk, the feelin' that you stay for
In time I want to be your best friend
East side love is living on the West End

Knocked out, but boy, you better come to
Don't die, you know, the truth is some do 
Go write your message on the pavement
Burn so bright, I wonder what the wave meant

Kick start the golden generator
Sweet talk but don't intimidate her
Can't stop the gods from engineering
Feel no need for any interfering

Your image in the dictionary
This life is more than ordinary
Can I get two, maybe even three of these?
Comin' from the space to teach you of the Pleiades

Can't stop the spirits when they need you
This life is more than just a read-through

Lyrics:
I shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot the deputy
I shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot the deputy

All around in my home town
They're trying to track me down
They say they want to bring me in guilty
For the killing of a deputy
For the life of a deputy
But I say

I shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot no deputy
I shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot no deputy

Sheriff John Brown always hated me
For what I don't know
Every time that I plant a seed
He said, ""Kill it before it grows""
He said, ""Kill it before it grows""
I say

I shot the sheriff, but I swear it was in self-defense
I shot the sheriff, and they say it is a capital offense

Freedom came my way one day
And I started out of town
All of a sudden I see sheriff John Brown
Aiming to shoot me down
So I, so I had to shoot him down
I say

I shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot no deputy
I shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot no deputy

Reflexes got the better of me
And what will be, will be
Every day the bucket goes to the well
But one day the bottom will drop out
Yes, one day the bottom will drop out
But I say

I shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot no deputy
I shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot no deputy

#U2 #SweetestThing #Remastered

Lyrics:

My love, she throws me like a rubber ball
(Oh, the sweetest thing.)
But she won't catch me or break my fall.
(Oh, the sweetest thing.)
Baby's got blue skies up ahead
But in this, I'm a raincloud
You know she wants a dry kind of love.
(Oh, the sweetest thing.)

I'm losin' you, I'm losin' you
Ain't love the sweetest thing?

I wanted to run, but she made me crawl
(Oh, the sweetest thing.)
Eternal fire, she turned me to straw.
(Oh, the sweetest thing.)
I know I got black eyes
But they burn so brightly for her
I guess it's a blind kind of love.
(Oh, the sweetest thing.)

I'm losin' you, I'm losin' you
Ain't love the sweetest thing?
Ain't love the sweetest thing?

Blue-eyed boy meets a brown-eyed girl.
(Oh, the sweetest thing.)
You can sew it up, but you still see the tear.
(Oh, the sweetest thing.)
Baby's got blue skies up ahead
But in this, I'm a rain-cloud,
Ours is a stormy kind of love.

Lyrics:
You only see what your eyes want to see
How can life be what you want it to be
You're frozen
When your heart's not open

You're so consumed with how much you get
You waste your time with hate and regret
You're broken
When your heart's not open

Mmmmmm, if I could melt your heart
Mmmmmm, we'd never be apart
Mmmmmm, give yourself to me
Mmmmmm, you hold the key

Now there's no point in placing the blame
And you should know I suffer the same
If I lose you
My heart will be broken

Love is a bird, she needs to fly
Let all the hurt inside of you die
You're frozen
When your heart's not open

Mmmmmm, if I could melt your heart
Mmmmmm, we'd never be apart
Mmmmmm, give yourself to me
Mmmmmm, you hold the key

You only see what your eyes want to see
How can life be what you want it to be
You're frozen
When your heart's not open

Mmmmmm, if I could melt your heart
Mmmmmm, we'd never be apart
Mmmmmm, give yourself to me
Mmmmmm, you hold the key

If I could melt your heart
Mmmmmm, we'd never be apart
Mmmmmm, give yourself to me
Mmmmmm, you hold the key

If I could melt your heart

Lyrics:
The cycle repeated
As explosions broke in the sky
All that I needed
Was the one thing I couldn't find

And you were there at the turn
Waiting to let me know

We're building it up to break it back down
We're building it up to burn it down
We can't wait to burn it to the ground

The colors conflicted
As the flames climbed into the clouds
I wanted to fix this
But couldn't stop from tearing it down

And you were there at the turn
Caught in the burning glow
And I was there at the turn
Waiting to let you know

We're building it up to break it back down
We're building it up to burn it down
We can't wait to burn it to the ground

You told me yes, you held me high
And I believed when you told that lie
I played soldier, you played king
And struck me down when I kissed that ring
You lost that right to hold that crown
I built you up but you let me down
So when you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames as your blazes burn

And you were there, at the turn
Waiting to let me know

We're building it up to break it back down
We're building it up to burn it down
We can't wait to burn it to the ground

When you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames as your blazes burn
We can't wait to burn it to the ground
When you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames as your blazes burn
We can't wait to burn it to the ground

And when you feel weak, you feel like you wanna just give up
But you gotta search within you
And gotta find that inner strength
And just pull that shit out of you
And get that motivation to not give up
And not be a quitter, no matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face, and collapse
Till I collapse I'm spilling these raps long as you feel 'em
Till the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killing 'em
‘Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop penning 'em
And I am not hip hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sending 'em?
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxicillin's just not real enough
The criminal cop killin', hip-hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're coming with me, feel it or not, you're gonna fear it
Like I showed you the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up?
Fa shizzel, my wizzel, this is the plot, listen up
You bizzels forgot, Slizzel does not give a fuck
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse
[x2]
Music is like magic, there's a certain feeling you get
When you real and you spit, and people are feeling your shit
This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
Tryna hold on to it because you may never get it again
So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end
Because I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in
It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie
Andre from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas, and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around
Like nothing's bothering me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it, but you know respect you got to give me
The press's wet dream, like Bobby and Whitney; Nate, hit me
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse
[x2]
Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an emcee's heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd how people hang on every word
I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
‘Cause in my heart of hearts
I know nothing could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack, like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't want to go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launching at 'em
The track is on some battling raps, who want some static?
‘Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse
[x2]
Until the roof (until the roof)
The roof comes off (the roof comes off)
Until my legs (until my legs)

Lyrics: 
Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends
Like my father's come to pass
Seven years has gone so fast
Wake me up when September ends

Here comes the rain again
Falling from the stars
Drenched in my pain again
Becoming who we are
As my memory rests
But never forgets what I lost
Wake me up when September ends

Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends
Ring out the bells again
Like we did when spring began
Wake me up when September ends

Here comes the rain again
Falling from the stars
Drenched in my pain again
Becoming who we are
As my memory rests
But never forgets what I lost
Wake me up when September ends

Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends
Like my father's come to pass
Twenty years has gone so fast
Wake me up when September ends

Wake me up when September ends
Wake me up when September ends...

Lyrics:

Honey, honey
I can see the stars all the way from here
Can't you see the glow on the window pane?
I can feel the sun whenever you're near
Every time you touch me I just melt away
Now everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear (They say love hurts)
But I know (It's gonna take a real work)
Nothing's perfect, but it's worth it after fighting through my tears
And finally you put me first

Lyrics:
It's a God-awful small affair
To the girl with the mousy hair
But her mummy is yelling no
And her daddy has told her to go
But her friend is nowhere to be seen
Now she walks through her sunken dream
To the seat with the clearest view
And she's hooked to the silver screen
But the film is a saddening bore
For she's lived it ten times or more
She could spit in the eyes of fools
As they ask her to focus on
Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh man, look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man, wonder if he'll ever know
He's in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?
It's on America's tortured brow
That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
Now the workers have struck for fame
'Cause Lennon's on sale again
See the mice in their million hordes
From Ibiza to the Norfolk Broads
Rule Britannia is out of bounds
To my mother, my dog, and clowns
But the film is a saddening bore
'Cause I wrote it ten times or more
It's about to be writ again
As I ask you to focus on
Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh man, look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man, wonder if he'll ever know
He's in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?

About David Bowie:
David Bowie redefined musical genres and the potential of live performance for generations of music lovers. Creating and discarding a variety of personae and restlessly challenging musical boundaries, Bowie released timeless albums including Space Oddity, Hunky Dory, The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust…, Aladdin Sane, Diamond Dogs, Young Americans, Station to Station, ""Heroes,” Let's Dance, Heathen, The Next Day and many more. Blackstar, Bowie’s 28th and final studio album, was released on his 69th birthday, January 8, 2016. David Bowie died on January 10, 2016, two days after the release of Blackstar. His body of work, his influence on the worlds of music, art, fashion, film, theatre and beyond, and his legacy of innovation and reinvention will live forever. 2022 kicks off with Bowie at 75, a celebration of his 75th birthday with the Brilliant Adventure box set, the previously unreleased Toy, the 50th anniversary of Ziggy Stardust and a series of special events.

Lyrics:
Hey! Mr. Tambourine man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey! Mr. Tambourine man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you
Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand
Vanished from my hand
Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet
I have no one to meet
And the ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming
Hey! Mr. Tambourine man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey! Mr. Tambourine man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you
Take me on a trip upon your magic swirling ship
My senses have been stripped
My hands can't feel to grip
My toes too numb to step
Wait only for my boot heels to be wandering
I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade
Into my own parade
Cast your dancing spell my way, I promise to go under it
Hey! Mr. Tambourine man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey! Mr. Tambourine man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you
Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun
It's not aimed at anyone
It's just escaping on the run
And but for the sky there are no fences facing
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
To your tambourine in time
It's just a ragged clown behind
I wouldn't pay it any mind
It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing
Hey! Mr. Tambourine man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey! Mr. Tambourine man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you
And take me disappearing through the smoke rings of my mind
Down the foggy ruins of time
Far past the frozen leaves
The haunted frightened trees
Out to the windy beach
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky
With one hand waving free
Silhouetted by the sea
Circled by the circus sands
With all memory and fate
Driven deep beneath the waves
Let me forget about today until tomorrow
Hey! Mr. Tambourine man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey! Mr. Tambourine man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you

Lyrics:
How many roads must a man walk down
Before you call him a man?
How many seas must a white dove sail
Before she sleeps in the sand?
Yes, 'n' how many times must the cannon balls fly
Before they're forever banned?
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind
Yes, 'n' how many years can a mountain exist
Before it's washed to the sea?
Yes, 'n' how many years can some people exist
Before they're allowed to be free?
Yes, 'n' how many times can a man turn his head
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind
Yes, 'n' how many times must a man look up
Before he can see the sky?
Yes, 'n' how many ears must one man have
Before he can hear people cry?
Yes, 'n' how many deaths will it take till he knows
That too many people have died?
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind

MPL and the Concord Music Group are proud to announce two more landmark instalments in the multiple GRAMMY-winning Paul McCartney Archive Collection. 

On 2nd October, 2015, Paul’s early ‘80s back-to-back classics 'Tug of War' and 'Pipes of Peace' will receive lavish multiple configuration reissue treatment including exclusive 2015 remixes of both the entire 'Tug of War' album and the 'Pipes of Peace' classic collaboration with Michael Jackson 'Say Say Say,' a treasure trove of previously unreleased tracks and never before seen video, and much more.

Released in 1982, 'Tug of War' was Paul’s first album following the break-up of Wings and his third solo LP overall. Hailed upon its release as “exquisitely crafted” by The New York Times and a “masterpiece” by Rolling Stone, 'Tug of War' went to #1 in no less than nine countries. 'Tug of War' yielded such classic tracks as Paul’s #1 duet with Stevie Wonder 'Ebony and Ivory,' the top 10 single 'Take It Away,' and of course 'Here Today,' the conversation Paul never had with the late John Lennon that remains a staple of Paul’s live set to this day.

As with the GRAMMY-winning 'Band on the Run' and 'Wings Over America' Archive editions, Paul personally supervised all aspects of these releases and their various formats, which include:
 
'Tug of War' will be issued as a 2-CD Special Edition comprised of the 2015 remix of the entire album, plus a second disc of bonus audio featuring eight previously unreleased demos of both album tracks and outtakes 'Stop, You Don’t Know Where She Came From' and 'Something That Didn’t Happen,' as well as demo and solo versions of 'Ebony and Ivory' and more. 

The 'Tug Of War' 3-CD/1-DVD Deluxe Edition adds the original 1982 album mix and a DVD featuring original music videos for the album’s singles and the brand new 18-minute documentary 'Fly TIA—Behind The Scenes on Take It Away' featuring previously unseen archival footage. 

In keeping with the award-winning Paul McCartney Archive Collection standards, the 'Tug of War' Deluxe Edition will include a 112-page essay book and 64-page scrapbook, while the strictly limited run of 1000 Super Deluxe sets will arrive in a limited edition acrylic slipcase with five hand numbered prints of images from the Linda McCartney archive. 

Both albums and their companion bonus audio discs will also be released as 2-LP 180-gram audiophile vinyl editions complete with gatefold sleeves and download cards. The newly remixed and mastered 'Tug of War' and remastered 'Pipes of Peace' will also receive standard and Hi Res digital releases, as well deluxe digital and Hi Res releases featuring all bonus audio.
 
'Tug of War' and 'Pipes of Peace' are the newest instalments in the acclaimed and ongoing Paul McCartney Archive Collection. The inaugural release in the series, the Deluxe Edition of Paul McCartney and Wings’ 1973 milestone 'Band on the Run', won the 2010 GRAMMY Award for Best Historical Album, while the Deluxe Edition Box Set of the 1976 classic live collection 'Wings Over America' took the 2013 GRAMMY for Best Boxed or Special Limited Edition Package. 

Previous releases in this ambitious reissue program encompassing 41 years of timeless material from the most successful songwriter and recording artist of all time include solo works 'McCartney' and 'McCartney II', Paul and Linda McCartney’s 'RAM', and Wings’ 'Venus and Mars' and 'At The Speed Of Sound'.",0.692,139.0,album,https://open.spotify.com/artist/4STHEaNw4mPZ2tzheohgXB,0.567,226267.0,False,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuAYkY2tCWY,Tug Of War,232.4,0.098,4.971045,1960–present,United Kingdom,100 million,Rock,1970,66 million

#U2 #Vertigo 

Lyrics:

Unos dos tres catorce!

Lights go down, it's dark
The jungle is your head
Can't rule your heart
A feeling is so much stronger than
A thought
Your eyes are wide
And though your soul
It can't be bought
Your mind can wander

Hello hello
I'm at a place called Vertigo
It's everything I wish I didn't know
Except you give me something I can feel, feel

The night is full of holes
As bullets rip the sky
Of ink with gold
They twinkle as the
Boys play rock and roll
They know they can't dance
At least they know.

I can't stand the beats
I'm asking for the cheque
The girl with crimson nails
Has Jesus round her neck
Swinging to the music
Swinging to the music
Oh oh oh oh

Hello hello
I'm at a place called Vertigo
It's everything I wish I didn't know
But you give me something I can feel, feel

Check mated
Oh yeah
Hours of fun

All of this, all of this can be yours
All of this, all of this can be yours

All of this, all of this can be yours
Just give me what I want and no-one gets hurt.

Hello hello
We're at a place called Vertigo
Lights go down and all I know
Is that you give me something

I can feel your love teaching me how
Your love is teaching me how, how to kneel

Lyrics: 

The heart is a bloom, shoots up through stony ground
But there's no room, no space to rent in this town
You're out of luck and the reason that you had to care,
The traffic is stuck and you're not moving anywhere.
You thought you'd found a friend to take you out of this place
Someone you could lend a hand in return for grace

It's a beautiful day, the sky falls
And you feel like it's a beautiful day
It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away

You're on the road but you've got no destination
You're in the mud, in the maze of her imagination
You love this town even if it doesn't ring true
You've been all over and it's been all over you

It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away

Touch me, take me to that other place
Teach me, I know I'm not a hopeless case

See the world in green and blue
See China right in front of you
See the canyons broken by cloud
See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out
See the bedouin fires at night
See the oil fields at first light
See the bird with a leaf in her mouth
After the flood all the colours came out
It was a beautiful day
A beautiful day
Don't let it get away

Touch me, take me to that other place
Reach me, I know Im not a hopeless case

What you don't have you don't need it now
What you don't know you can feel it somehow
What you don't have you don't need it now
You don't need it now, you don't need it now
Beautiful day

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
There must be lights burning brighter somewhere
Got to be birds flying higher in a sky more blue
If I can dream of a better land, where all my brothers walk hand in hand
Tell me why, oh why, oh why can't my dream come true, oh why

[Verse 2]
There must be peace and understanding sometime
Strong wind of promise that will blow away the doubt and fear
If I can dream of a warmer sun, where hope keeps shining on everyone
Tell me why, oh why, oh why won't that sun appear


[Bridge]
We're lost in a cloud with too much rain
We're trapped in a world that's troubled with pain
But as long as a man has the strength to dream
He can redeem his soul and fly (He can fly)

[Verse 3]
Deep in my heart, there's a trembling question
Still, I am sure that the answer's... answer's gonna come somehow
Out there in the dark, there's a beckoning candle, yeah
And while I can think, while I can talk, while I can stand, while I can walk
While I can dream, oh, please let my dream come true, oh, right now

[Outro]
Let it come true right now

Lyrics
Kindness in your eyes
I guess you heard me cry
You smiled at me
Like jesus to a child
I'm blessed i know
Heaven sent and heaven stole
You smiled at me like
Jesus to a child
And what have i learned
From all this pain
I thought i'd never feel the same
About anyone or anything again
But now i know

When you find a love
When you know that it exists
Then the lover that you miss
Will come to you on those cold, cold nights
When you've been loved
When you know it holds such bliss
Then the lover that you kissed
Will comfort you when there's no hope in sight",0.415,7625.0,album,https://open.spotify.com/artist/19ra5tSw0tWufvUp8GotLo,0.534,411147.0,True,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNBj4EV_hAo,Older,"2,330.8",1.041,5.0,1981–2016,United Kingdom,100 million,Pop,1984,52.8 million

IT'S ONLY LOVE

When the feelin' is ended
There ain't no use pretendin'
Don't ya worry it's only love

When your world has been shattered
Ain't nothin' else matters
It ain't over it's only love
And that's all ya

When your heart has been broken
Hard words have been spoken
It ain't easy but it's only love

And if your life ain't worth livin'
And you're ready to give in
Just remember that it's only love

You can live without the aggravation
Ya gotta wanna win ya gotta wanna win
You keep lookin' back in desperation
Over and over and over again

When your world is shattered
Ain't nothin' else matters
It ain't over it's only love
If your life ain't worth livin'
And you're ready to give in
Just remember that it's only love
Yeah, that's all
Yeah it ain't easy baby
But it's only love and that's all

#U2 #WithOrWithoutYou #Remastered

Lyrics:

See the stone set in your eyes
See the thorn twist in your side.
I wait for you.
Sleight of hand and twist of fate
On a bed of nails she makes me wait
And I wait– without you

With or without you
With or without you.

Through the storm, we reach the shore
You gave it all but I want more
And I'm waiting for you–

With or without you
With or without you.
I can't live with or without you.

And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give, and you give
And you give yourself away.

My hands are tied, my body bruised
She got me with nothing to win
And nothing else to lose.

And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give, and you give
And you give yourself away.

With or without you
With or without you
I can't live
With or without you.

With or without you
With or without you
I can't live
With or without you
With or without you.",0.429,18001.0,album,https://open.spotify.com/artist/51Blml2LZPmy7TTiAg47vQ,0.54,295516.0,True,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujNeHIo7oTE,The Joshua Tree (Super Deluxe),"2,130.8",0.708,5.0,1976–present,Ireland,150 million,Rock,1980,114.6 million

Lyrics: 
I remember every little thing
As if it happened only yesterday
Parking by the lake
And there was not another car in sight
And I never had a girl
Looking any better than you did
And all the kids at school
They were wishing they were me that night

And now our bodies are, oh, so close and tight
It never felt so good, it never felt so right
And we're glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife
Glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife
C'mon, hold on tight
C'mon, hold on tight

Though it's cold and lonely in the deep dark night
I can see paradise by the dashboard light

Lyrics: 
Gettin' born in the state of Mississippi
Papa was a copper and mama was a hippie
In Alabama she would swing a hammer
Price you gotta pay when you pick the panorama
She never knew that there was anything more than poor
What in the world? What does your company take me for?

Black bandana, sweet Louisiana
Robbin' on a bank in the state of Indiana
She's a runner, rebel and a stunner
Oh her merry way sayin' baby whatcha gonna
Lookin' down the barrel of a hot metal forty five
Just another way to survive

[Chorus:]
California rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California show your teeth
She's my priestess, I'm your priest, yeah, yeah

She's a lover baby and a fighter
Shoulda seen her coming when it got a little brighter
With a name like Dani California
Day was gonna come when I was gonna mourn ya
A little loaded, she was stealin' another breath
I love my baby to death

[Chorus]

Who knew the other side of you?
Who knew what others died to prove?
Too true to say good bye to you
Too true to say say say...

Push the fader, gifted animator
One for the now and eleven for the later
Never made it up to Minnesota
North Dakota man was a gunnin' for the quota

Down in the badlands she was savin' the best for last
It only hurts when I laugh
Gone too fast...

Lyrics:
Por completarte me rompí en pedazos
Me lo advirtieron, pero no hice caso
Me di cuenta que lo tuyo es falso
Fue la gota que rebalsó el vaso

[Pre-Coro: Shakira]
No me digas que lo sientes
Eso parece sincero, pero te conozco bien y sé que mientes

[Coro: Shakira]
Te felicito, qué bien actúas
De eso no me cabe duda
Con tu papel continúa

Te queda bien ese show
Te felicito, qué bien actúas
De eso no me cabe duda
Con tu papel continúa
Te queda bien ese show
Te felicito, qué bien actúas

[Verso 1: Shakira]
Esa filosofía barata no la compro
Lo siento, en esa moto ya no me monto
La gente de dos caras no la soporto
Yo que ponía las manos al fuego por ti
Y me tratas como una más de tus antojos
Tu herida no me abrió la piel, pero sí los ojos

Los tengo rojos de tanto llorar por ti

[Pre-Coro: Shakira]
Y ahora resulta que lo sientes
Suena sincero, pero te conozco bien y sé que mientes

[Coro: Rauw Alejandro & Shakira]
Te felicito, qué bien actúas
De eso no me cabe duda
Con tu papel continúa
Te queda bien ese show
Te felicito, qué bien actúas
De eso no me cabe duda
Con tu papel continúa

Te queda bien ese show
Te felicito, qué bien actúas (Ey, dice, Ra-Rauw)

[Verso 2: Rauw Alejandro]
Hablándote claro, no te necesito (Yeah)
Perdiste a alguien auténtico (Ah)
Algo me decía por qué no fluiamo' (¡Wuh!)
Te va a picar cuando recuerde’ cómo nos comíamo' (¡Yah!)
Como ante' (Ey)
Tú de espalda apoyándote del volante (Ey)
Quemando el tranquilizante
No te bloqueé de las rede' pa' que vea' la otra en la Mercede' (¡Yah!)

[Puente: Shakira]
No me cuente’ más historia’, no quiero saber
Cómo es que he sido tan ciega y no he podido ver
Te deberían dar un Oscar, lo has hecho tan bien

[Coro: Shakira & Rauw Alejandro]
Te felicito, qué bien actúas
De eso no me cabe duda
Con tu papel continúa
Te queda bien ese show
Te felicito, qué bien actúas
De eso no me cabe duda
Con tu papel continúa
Te queda bien ese show
Te felicito, qué bien actúas

Lyrics:
El Rvssian

Aquella noche que volviste 
Llorando me Convenciste
Que tu no quería hacerme daño 
Hicimos el amor en el baño 

Tu mirada no es confiable
Como Tokyo inestable 
Sin importar el daño que has causado 
Te quiero pa atrás y eso es malo 

Malo malo pero malo 
Te quiero pa atrás y eso es malo 
Malo malo pero malo 
Estar cerca de ti pa mi eso es malo 
Pa mi eso es malo 

I’m tryna keep you warm
Quarentining with me for no reason 
Love drunk got me floored
Left your Chanel bag in my Porsche 
I shoulda dropped you off
Memories we repeat every weekend
Lie like this before
You do me when you get bored 
It ain’t no problem 
It’s cool what you doing tonight 
Long as you keep coming and I’m fucking you right
Lil mami amor
Another chance for me to give you what’s yours
And I know that it’s bad
When I let you pull me right back 
Cause you never promise tomorrow 
You give me your love but it’s borrowed 
Lay you down and forget all the past 
Only one that could do me like that 
How you coming and goin is tidal 
You wrapped on my body but I know

Malo malo pero malo 
Te quiero pa atrás y eso es malo 
Malo malo pero malo 
Estar cerca de ti pa mi eso es malo 

Baby se acabo 
Te corté de raíz ahora dónde ponerte decido yo 
Que se muera mi flor 
Difícil me la puso 
Acabo de ver en mi carro que su cartera se quedó
A propósito la dejó 
Siempre pone una excusa pa volverme a ver 
Después que peleamos me lo quiere hacer 
Con solo un beso se me olvidó 
Todo lo que ella me hizo 

Aquella noche que volviste 
Llorando me convenciste 
que tu no quería hacerme daño 
Hicimos el amor en el baño 
Tu mirada no es confiable 
Como Tokyo inestable 
Sin importar el daño que has causado 
Te quiero pa atrás y eso es malo 

Malo malo pero malo 
Te quiero pa atrás y eso es malo 
Malo malo pero malo 
Estar cerca de ti pa mi eso es malo 
Pa mi eso es malo

Lyrics: 
Do you have the time
To listen to me whine
About nothing and everything all at once?
I am one of those
Melodramatic fools
Neurotic to the bone, no doubt about it

Sometimes, I give myself the creeps
Sometimes, my mind plays tricks on me

It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Am I just stoned?

And I went to a shrink
To analyze my dreams
She says it's lack of sex that's bringing me down
And I went to a whore
He said my life's a bore
So quit my whining 'cause it's bringing her down

Sometimes, I give myself the creeps
Sometimes, my mind plays tricks on me

It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Huh yeah, yeah, yeah (Ooh, ooh)

Grasping to control
So I better hold on

Sometimes, I give myself the creeps
Sometimes, my mind plays tricks on me

It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Am I just stoned?

“‘Screaming Suicide’ addresses the taboo word of suicide. The intention is to communicate about the darkness we feel inside. It's ridiculous to think we should deny that we have these thoughts. At one point or another, I believe most people have thought about it. To face it is to speak the unspoken. If it's a human experience, we should be able to talk about it. You are not alone.”

LYRICS

Welcome to this life
Born into the fight
Here to claim your dream
Look you in the eye
Patch the broken sky
Craving dopamine
Then my voice appears
Teaching you of fears
Are you good enough?
You don’t recognize
Head is full of lies
You should just give up
 
Listen well, better listen well
Listen well, better listen well
 
Don’t ever speak my name
Remember you’re to blame
Keep me inside
Keep me inside
My name is suicide
 
Curse another day
Spirit locked away
Punish and deprive
Hate to be awake
Living a mistake
More dead than alive
Then a voice appears
Whisper in your ears
“You are good enough”
Throwing down a rope
A lifeline of hope
Never give you up
 
Listen well, better listen well
Listen well, better listen well
 
Don’t ever speak my name
Remember you’re to blame
Keep me inside
Keep me inside
My name is suicide

Terrified in sleepless nights
Caught in spotlight dead to rights
Isolate and fight your mind
Telling you you’re left behind

My lying voice inside
Keeps drinking cyanide
And no more can you run
Into the sun

Terrified, sleepless nights
Caught in spotlight dead to rights
Isolate and fight your mind
Telling you you’re left behind

And now you speak my name
You’ve given back the blame
Keep me deep inside
Don’t you keep me inside
Screaming suicide

Now that I’m exposed inside
Shined a light on cyanide
I’m no longer needed here
Now you've faced your biggest fear

Written by James Hetfield, Lars Ulrich & Robert Trujillo

Lyrics:

Oh, yeah
Mmm
Still don't know what I was waitin' for
And my time was runnin' wild
A million dead end streets and
Every time I thought I'd got it made
It seemed the taste was not so sweet
So I turned myself to face me
But I've never caught a glimpse
How the others must see the faker
I'm much too fast to take that test

Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Don't want to be a richer man
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
There's gonna have to be a different man
Time may change me
But I can't trace time

Mmm, yeah

I watch the ripples change their size
But never leave the stream
Of warm impermanence
And so the days float through my eyes
But still the days seem the same
And these children that you spit on
As they try to change their worlds
Are immune to your consultations
They're quite aware of what they're goin' through

Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Don't tell them to grow up and out of it
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Where's your shame?
You've left us up to our necks in it
Time may change me
But you can't trace time

Strange fascinations fascinate me
Ah, changes are taking
The pace I'm goin' through

Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Ooh, look out, you rock 'n' rollers
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Pretty soon now you're gonna get older
Time may change me
But I can't trace time
I said that time may change me
But I can't trace time

About David Bowie:
David Bowie redefined musical genres and the potential of live performance for generations of music lovers. Creating and discarding a variety of personae and restlessly challenging musical boundaries, Bowie released timeless albums including Space Oddity, Hunky Dory, The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust…, Aladdin Sane, Diamond Dogs, Young Americans, Station to Station, ""Heroes,” Let's Dance, Heathen, The Next Day and many more. Blackstar, Bowie’s 28th and final studio album, was released on his 69th birthday, January 8, 2016. David Bowie died on January 10, 2016, two days after the release of Blackstar. His body of work, his influence on the worlds of music, art, fashion, film, theatre and beyond, and his legacy of innovation and reinvention will live forever. 2022 kicks off with Bowie at 75, a celebration of his 75th birthday with the Brilliant Adventure box set, the previously unreleased Toy, the 50th anniversary of Ziggy Stardust and a series of special events.

Lyrics:

Like a gift from the heavens, it was easy to tell,
It was love from above, that could save me from hell,
She had fire in her soul it was easy to see,
How the devil himself could be pulled out of me,
There were drums in the air as she started to dance,
Every soul in the room keeping time with their hands,
And we sang...

Ay oh ay oh ay oh ay,
And the voices rang like the angels sing,
We're singing...
Ay oh ay oh ay oh ay,
And we danced on into the night,
Ay oh ay oh,
Ay oh ay oh,
And we danced on into the night.",0.809,9920.0,album,https://open.spotify.com/artist/6GI52t8N5F02MxU0g5U69P,0.592,222172.0,True,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ9nQNx0KEs,Splendiferous Santana,"1,490.9",0.57,3.0,1966–present,United States,100 million,Rock,1969,62.8 million

Lyrics:
Eurus
Afer Ventus

So the world goes round and round
With all you ever knew
They say the sky high above
Is Caribbean blue...

If every man says all he can
If every man is true
Do I believe the sky above
Is Caribbean blue...

... Boreas...
... Zephyrus...

If all they told was turned to gold
If all you dreamed was new
Imagine the sky high above
In Caribbean blue...

... Eurus...

... Boreas
Zephyrus...

Lyrics
I feel so unsure
As I take your hand
And lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies
Something in your eyes
Calls to mind a silver screen
And all its sad goodbyes

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should've known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you

Time can never mend
The careless whispers of a good friend
To the heart and mind
Ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth
Pain is all you'll find

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should've known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you

Tonight the music seems so loud
I wish that we could lose this crowd
Maybe it's better this way
We'd hurt each other with the things we want to say
We could have been so good together
We could have lived this dance forever
But now who's gonna dance with me
Please stay

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should've known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you

Now that you're gone
Now that you're gone
Now that you're gone
Was what I did so wrong
So wrong that you had to leave me alone?",0.628,257392.0,compilation,https://open.spotify.com/artist/19ra5tSw0tWufvUp8GotLo,0.574,300107.0,True,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izGwDsrQ1eQ,Ladies And Gentlemen...

Enya was born Eithne Ni Bhraonain in Donegal, Ireland. Enya studied classical music at college under private tuition. On leaving college she was asked by Producer Nicky Ryan to join her siblings in their family band. She did so for a short time, but found it too restrictive musically, and so in 1982 she joined Nicky Ryan and Roma Ryan in a creative and business partnership. Enya's first commission was to write a score for Sir David Puttnam for his film ""The Frog Prince"". Then, the triumvirate secured the soundtrack to the BBC documentary series 'The Celts'. Enya was then signed by Warner Music and all three by EMI Music Publishing. The first album of this contract was ""Watermark"" with the hit single ""Orinoco Flow"". This was followed by ""Shepherd Moons"", ""The Memory of Trees"", ""Paint the Sky With Stars"", ""A Day Without Rain"" which produced the single, ""Only Time"". Enya also released ""Amarantine"" and for Lord of the Rings; the Fellowship of the Ring, the songs ""Aniron"" and ""May it Be"". Enya, Nicky and Roma were nominated for a Golden Globe Award and for an Academy Award for the song ""May it Be"" and have also merited many other nominations and awards, including the Ivor Novello for International Achievement. The latest honours bestowed on Enya were two Honorary Degrees, the University of Galway honoured her with Doctor of Music and the University of Ulster honoured Enya with Doctor of Letters.

Lyrics:
¿Cómo puede ser verdad?
[English translation: ""How could it be true?""]

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
[""The beautiful island""]

And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo te amo
[""He told you, 'I love you.'""]
I prayed that the days would last
They went so fast

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita

And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita

And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita

And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

Te dijo te amo
El dijo que te ama
[""He said he loves you""]

La isla bonita
Your Spanish lullaby

Lyrics:
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
Don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

Can't you see that you're smothering me
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control?
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart right in front of you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
And every second I waste is more than I can take

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

And I know
I may end up failing too
But I know
You were just like me with someone disappointed in you

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
(I'm tired of being what you want me to be)
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
(I'm tired of being what you want me to be)

Lyrics:
I see a red door and I want it painted black
No colors anymore I want them to turn black

I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

I see a line of cars and they're all painted black
With flowers and my love both never to come back

I see people turn their heads and quickly look away
Like a new born baby it just happens every day

I look inside myself and see my heart is black
I see my red door, I must have it painted black

Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts
It's not easy facin' up when your whole world is black

No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee this thing happening to you

If I look hard enough into the settin' sun
My love will laugh with me before the mornin' comes

I see a red door and I want it painted black
No colors anymore I want them to turn black

I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

I wanna see your face, painted black
Black as night, black as coal

I wanna see the sun flying high in the sky
I wanna see it painted, painted, painted, painted black
Yeah!

Lyrics: 

2X
No fue culpa tuya 
ni tampoco mía 
fue culpa de la monotonía 
nunca dije nada pero me dolía 
yo sabía que esto pasaría 

Tu en lo tuyo y haciendo lo mismo 
siempre buscando protagonismo 
te olvidaste de lo que un dia fuimos
y lo peor es que 

No fue culpa tuya 
ni tampoco mía 
fue culpa de la monotonía 
nunca dije nada pero me dolía 
yo sabía que esto pasaría 

De repente no eras el mismo
me dejaste por tu narcisismo 
te olvidaste de lo que un día fuimos 

Tu distante con tu actitud 
y eso me llenaba de inquietud 
tú no daba ni la mitad 
pero sí sé que di más que tú 
estaba corriendo por alguien       
que por mí ni estaba caminando 

Este amor no muerto pero esta delirando
ya de lo que había ya no hay na
te lo digo con sinceridad 
tu estas frío como en Navidad 
es mejor que esto se acabe ya 
no me repita la movie otra vez que esa ya la vi 

Bebe yo te quiero pero es que yo me quiero más a mí 
es un adios necesario 
lo que un día fue increíble se volvió rutinario
no me saben a nada tus labios 
ahora es todo lo contrario 
y lo peor es que

No fue culpa tuya 
ni tampoco mía 
fue culpa de la monotonía 
nunca dije nada pero me dolía 
yo sabía que esto pasaría 

Tu en lo tuyo y haciendo lo mismo 
siempre buscando protagonismo
te olvidaste de lo que un día fuimos (ambos)
eh eh eh (ambos)

Lyrics:
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming, confusing
This lack of self-control I fear is never-ending
Controlling, I can't seem

To find myself again, my walls are closing in
Without a sense of confidence
I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take
I've felt this way before, so insecure

Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

Discomfort endlessly has pulled itself upon me
Distracting, reacting
Against my will, I stand beside my own reflection
It's haunting how I can't seem

To find myself again, my walls are closing in
Without a sense of confidence
I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take
I've felt this way before, so insecure

Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real
Crawling in my skin
These wounds they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing, confusing what is real

(There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming)Confusing what is real
(This lack of self-control I fear is never-ending
Controlling)Confusing what is real

Lyrics:
In this farewell
There's no blood, there's no alibi
'Cause I've drawn regret
From the truth of a thousand lies
So let mercy come and wash away

What I've done
I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done

Put to rest what you thought of me
While I clean this slate
With the hands of uncertainty
So let mercy come and wash away

What I've done
I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done

For what I've done
I start again
And whatever pain may come
Today this ends
I'm forgiving

What I've done
I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done

(Na-na na na)
(Na-na na na)
(Na-na na na)
What I've done
(Na-na na na)
(Na-na na na)
(Na-na na na)
Forgiving what I've done
(Na-na na na)
(Na-na na na)

Lyrics
As Around The Sun The Earth Know She's Revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early may
Just as hate knows love's the cure
You can rest your mind assured that
I'll be loving you always

As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
But in passing will grow older everyday
Just as all that's born is new
You know what I say is true
That I'll be loving you always

Until the rainbow burns the stars out of the sky
Until the ocean covers every mountain high
Until the day that 8 times 8 times 8 is 4
Until the day that is the day that are no more

Did you know that true love asks for nothing
Her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last through forever and another day

As today I know I'm living but tomorrow
Could make me the past
But that I mustn't fear
I know deep in my mind
The love of me I've left behind
Cause I'll be loving you always

Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
Until the ocean covers every mountain high
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream
Until the day is night and night becomes the day
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away
Until the day that 8 times 8 times 8 is 4
Until the day that is the day that are no more

Did you know that true love asks for nothing?
Her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last through forever and another day

As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early may
For now I know deep in my mind
The love of me I've left behind
Cause I'll he loving you always.

Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
Until the ocean covers every mountain high
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream

Until the day is night and night becomes the day
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away

On stage rockin’ I’m stir crazy 
Cocoa flow like 1980’s
Come let’s tell a drop lazy
None of that maybe 
Energy, energy, energy 

Just vibe
Voting out 45, don’t get outta line
Pick a side
Only double lines we cross is dollars signs
Hold up 
Wait, I hear you just got paid make it rain
Energy

She more Cancun he more Saint Tropez
Big wave in the room and the crowd gon’ move
Look around everybody on mute
Look around it’s me and my crew
Big energy

He was on stop mode 
Got froze 
Froze front page vogue 
No pose
Chat too much full clip unload 
That’s that Kodak energy 
Energy, energy, energy

Gold links, raw denim
You know that we do it grande
You know that I’m gon’ be extra
When that camera go pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop
Keep ‘em waiting like dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot
Ooo la la la  
That’s the way dem boys sound when I walk through the block, block, block
Then I uzi that doozy shot, shot, shot

We was just chillin’ minding our business
Popping our pain and champagne though the ceiling
Sipping it up, flicking it up
All this good energy got you all in your feelings, feelings
I’m crazy, I’m swearing, I’m daring, your man’s staring
I just entered the country with derringers
Cause them Karens just turned into terrorists

He was on stop mode 
Got froze 
Froze front page vogue 
No pose
Chat too much full clip unload 
That’s that Kodak energy 
Energy, energy, energy

Straight From The Heart

I could start dreamin' but it never ends
As long as you're gone we may as well pretend
I've been dreamin' - straight from the heart

You say it's easy but who's to say
That we'd be able to keep it this way
But it's easier - comin' straight from the heart

Oh, give it to me straight from the heart
Tell me we can make another start
You know I'll never go - as long as I know
It's comin' straight from the heart

I’ll see you on the street some other time
And all my words would just fall out of line
While we're dreamin' - straight from the heart

Lyrics: 
Oh, oh

What I got you got to give it to your mamma
What I got you've got to give it to your pappa
What I got you got to give it to your daughter
You do a little dance and then you drink a little water
What I got you got to get it put it in you
What I got you got to get it put it in you
What I got you got to get it put it in you
Reeling with the feeling, don't stop, continue
I realize I don't want to be a miser
Confide with sly you'll be the wiser
Young blood is the lovin' upriser
How come everybody wanna keep it like the Kaiser

Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
I can't tell if I'm a kingpin or a pauper

Greedy little people in a sea of distress
Keep your more to receive your less
Unimpressed by material excess
Love is free, love me, say, ""Hell, yes""
Low brow but I rock a little know how
No time for the piggies or the hoosegow
Get smart get down with the pow wow
Never been a better time than right now
Bob Marley poet and a prophet
Bob Marley taught me how to off it
Bob Marley walkin' like he talk it
Goodness me can't you see I'm gonna cough it

Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Oh, oh yeah
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
I can't tell if I'm a kingpin or a pauper

Lucky me swimming in my ability
Dancing down on life with agility
Come and drink it up from my fertility
Blessed with a bucket of lucky mobility
My mom, I love her 'cause she love me
Long gone are the times when she scrub me
Feelin' good my brother gonna hug me
Drink my juice young love chug-a-lug me
Ah, there's a river born to be a giver
Keep you warm won't let you shiver
His heart is a never gonna wither
Come on, everybody, time to deliver

Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
I can't tell if I'm a kingpin or a pauper

What I got you got to give it to your mamma
What I got you've got to give it to your pappa
What I got you got to give it to your daughter
You do a little dance and then you drink a little water
What I got you got to get it put it in you
What I got you got to get it put it in you
What I got you got to get it put it in you
Reeling with the feeling, don't stop, continue
I realize I don't want to be a miser
Confide with sly you'll be the wiser
Young blood is the lovin' upriser
How come everybody wanna keep it like the Kaiser

Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now

Give it away now
Give it away now
Give it away now
Give it away now
Give it away now
Give it away now
Give it away now
Give it away now
Give it away now
Give it away now
Give it away now
Give it away now
Give it away now
Give it away now
Give it away now

Lyrics:
Build a fire and gather ‘round the tree
Fill a glass and maybe come and sing with me
 
So kiss me under the mistletoe
Pour out the wine let’s toast and pray for December snow
I know there’s been pain this year but it’s time to let it go
Next year you never know, but for now
Merry Christmas
 
We’ll dance in the kitchen while embers glow
We’ve both known love, but this love that we got is the best of all
I wish you could see you through my eyes then you would know
My god you look beautiful right now
Merry Christmas 
 
The fire is raging on
And we’ll all sing along to the songs
Just having so much fun
While we’re here can we all spare a thought for the ones who have gone
Merry Christmas everyone

So just keep kissing me under the mistletoe 
Pour out the wine let’s toast and pray for December snow
I know there’s been pain this year but it’s time to let it go
Next year you never know, but for now
Merry Christmas

We’ll dance in the kitchen while embers glow
We’ve both known love, but this love that we got is the best of all
I wish you could see you through my eyes then you would know
My god you look beautiful right now
Merry Christmas 

I feel it when it comes
Every year helping us carry on
Filled up with so much love
All our family and friends are together where we all belong
Merry Christmas everyone
 
It’s Christmas time for you and I
We’ll have a good night and a Merry Christmas 
It’s Christmas time for you and I
We’ll have a good night and a Merry Christmas

TRADUZIONE TESTO

[Ty Dolla $ign]
Non ho paura del buio
Non sto correndo, correndo, correndo
No, non ho paura della morte
Non ho paura, niente affatto
Perché una stella, una stella avrebbe mai paura del buio?
Io non ho paura
Non ho paura, anche dall'inizio
Non ho paura del buio
Del buio, mmm

[Lil Wayne]
Tunechi
Non ho mai paura e non sono mai inorridito
Ho appena guardato il mio Rolex, ha detto che sono i tempi più bui
Non sono mai terrorizzato, non sono mai pietrificato
Sai che vedo dei morti, li dico solo ""Fatti una vita""
Non ho mai “paura”, non sono sicuro che sia una parola, ma
Intendo ogni parola, sentendomi come ""non disturbare"", aspetta
Lasciami testimoniare, non ho mai testimoniato
E sono sposato con il mio orgoglio, non ho mai, mai pianto
Ho gli occhi come biglie, se piango brillano
Sai che posso leggere la tua mente come se fossi l'autore
C'è una linea per domani e quella linea si sta accorciando
Sono dietro il grilletto, e se fossi il bersaglio?
Profondo sospiro, un sayōnara, non ho paura di morire
E’ addio o buongiorno, e il cielo inizia a cadere
E io sto risplendendo nell'oscurità
Ripenso al mio Rolex, dice ""Tempo per il coro""
Sai che non ho paura

[Lil Wayne & Ty Dolla $ign]
Non ho paura del buio
(Non ho mai paura, non ho mai paura)
Non sto correndo, correndo, correndo
No, non ho paura della morte
(Sì, sì, sì, sì)
Non ho paura, niente affatto
(Non ho mai paura, non ho mai paura)
Perché una stella, una stella avrebbe mai paura del buio?
(Sì, sì, sì, sì)
Io non ho paura
(Sì, sì, sì, sì)
Non ho paura, anche dall'inizio
(Sì, sì, sì, sì)
Non ho paura del buio
(Non ho mai paura, non ho mai paura)
Del buio, mmm
(Non ho mai paura, non ho mai paura)
Si, si, si, si

[XXXTENTACION]
Si
Ok, metti il mio cuore da parte
Nei miei sentimenti, cavalchiamo
Grossa MAC di fianco
Se lei chiama, scivolerò
""La mia piccola"" Amico, sei pazzo
Potrebbe ottenere una nuova Mercedes
Lei dice che mi vuole, oowee
Ok, piccolina, facciamolo, uh-huh

[XXXTENTACION]
Se potessi contare le lacrime che ho versato
Un milione di volte, giuro che sono morto
Ci sto provando, ma non va ancora bene
L'unica volta che la voglio è di notte

[Lil Wayne & Ty Dolla $ign]
Non ho paura del buio
(Non ho mai paura, non ho mai paura)
Non sto correndo, correndo, correndo
No, non ho paura della morte
(Sì, sì, sì, sì)
Non ho paura, niente affatto
(Non ho mai paura, non ho mai paura)
Perché una stella, una stella avrebbe mai  paura del buio?
(Sì, sì, sì, sì)
Non ho paura (Sì, sì, sì, sì)

#GreenDay #Nimrod25 #GoodRiddanceTimeOfYourLife

Lyrics: 
Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road
Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go
So make the best of this test and don't ask why
It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time

It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life

So take the photographs and still frames in your mind
Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time
Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial
For what it's worth, it was worth all the while

It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life

It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life
It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life...

Lyrics:

One man come in the name of love
One man come and go.
One man come he to justify
One man to overthrow.

In the name of love
What more in the name of love.
In the name of love
What more in the name of love.

One man caught on a barbed wire fence
One man he resist
One man washed up on an empty beach
One man betrayed with a kiss.

In the name of love
What more in the name of love.
In the name of love
What more in the name of love.

Early morning, April four
Shot rings out in the Memphis sky.
Free at last, they took your life
They could not take your pride.

In the name of love
What more in the name of love.
In the name of love
What more in the name of love.

In the name of love
What more in the name of love.

Lyrics

Ah, ah, ah, ah

(Let's dance)
(Let's dance)
(Let's dance)
Put on your red shoes and dance the blues
(Let's dance)
To the song they're playing on the radio
(Let's sway)
While colour lights up your face
(Let's sway)
Sway through the crowd to an empty space

If you say run, I'll run with you
And if you say hide, we'll hide
Because my love for you
Would break my heart in two
If you should fall, into my arms
And tremble like a flower

(Let's dance)
(Let's dance)
(Let's dance)
For fear your grace should fall
(Let's dance)
For fear tonight is all
(Let's sway)
You could look into my eyes
(Let's sway)
Under the moonlight, this serious moonlight

And if you say run, I'll run with you
And if you say hide, we'll hide
Because my love for you
Would break my heart in two
If you should fall, into my arms
And tremble like a flower


(Let's dance)
(Let's dance)
(Let's dance)
Put on your red shoes and dance the blues
(Let's dance)
To the song we're playing
(Let's sway)
(Let's sway)
Under the moonlight, this serious moonlight

(Let's dance)
(Let's)
(Let's)
(Let's)
(Let's dance)
(Let's)

Let's dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance
(Let's dance)
(Let's sway)
(Let's sway)
Let's dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance
(Let's dance)
(Let's dance)
(Let's dance)

About David Bowie:
David Bowie redefined musical genres and the potential of live performance for generations of music lovers. Creating and discarding a variety of personae and restlessly challenging musical boundaries, Bowie released timeless albums including Space Oddity, Hunky Dory, The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust…, Aladdin Sane, Diamond Dogs, Young Americans, Station to Station, ""Heroes,” Let's Dance, Heathen, The Next Day and many more. Blackstar, Bowie’s 28th and final studio album, was released on his 69th birthday, January 8, 2016. David Bowie died on January 10, 2016, two days after the release of Blackstar. His body of work, his influence on the worlds of music, art, fashion, film, theatre and beyond, and his legacy of innovation and reinvention will live forever. 2022 kicks off with Bowie at 75, a celebration of his 75th birthday with the Brilliant Adventure box set, the previously unreleased Toy, the 50th anniversary of Ziggy Stardust and a series of special events.

""Billie Jean"" was the first short film made for 'Thriller,' the biggest-selling album of all time. The short film for this No. 1 single, directed by Steve Barron, made history as the first video by a black artist to receive heavy rotation on MTV, and was later ranked by the network as one of the 100 greatest music videos of all time.

Written & Composed by Michael Jackson
Produced by Quincy Jones for Quincy Jones Productions
Co-Produced by Michael Jackson for MJJ Productions, Inc.
From the album Thriller, released November 30, 1982
Released as a single January 2, 1983

THE SHORT FILM
Director: Steve Barron
Primary Production Location: Los Angeles, California

Michael Jackson's short film for ""Billie Jean"" was the first of three short films produced for recordings from Thriller, which continues its reign as the biggest selling album of all time with worldwide sales in excess of 105 million as of June 1, 2016 and in December, 2015 became the first ever album to be awarded triple diamond status by the RIAA for US sales alone. The """"Billie Jean"""" single reached No. 1 in 10 countries in the spring of 1983, including seven consecutive weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100 - becoming the second-highest selling single in America that same year.

""Billie Jean"" was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America on April 4, 1983, and Platinum on February 4, 1989. The song won two Grammy Awards for Best R&B Song and Best R&B Performance - Male, as well as an American Music Award for Favorite Single - Pop/Rock and was also named the Single of the Year on The Village Voice Pazz & Jop critics' poll in 1983.

The short film featured a paparazzo attempting to photograph Jackson as he danced through an urban landscape. A specially created set featured steps and sidewalk tiles that lit up underneath Michael's feet. It is here that fans first saw some of Michael's best-known dance moves, such as spinning and landing on his toes. Many of Michael's steps and mannerisms in the video would become forever associated with The King of Pop.

When the chorus hit.he sprung into this dance that was unlike anything I'd ever seen, director Steve Barron recounted of Jackson's choreography in the video. ""It was just extraordinary, instinctive. He pulled it all together and turned it into what we saw.The camera literally steamed up, the eyepiece steamed up, because of my heat from what I was seeing."" Barron also recalled the crew breaking into spontaneous applause after Michael finished dancing.

The ""Billie Jean"" short film made history as the first video by a black artist to be played in heavy rotation on MTV, then in its second year. In 1992, the short film was inducted into the Music Video Producers Hall of Fame. MTV ranked ""Billie Jean"" as the 35th greatest music video of all time in 1999, one of three entries of Jackson's on the chart alongside ""Thriller"" and ""Beat It.""

Lyrics:
Why does it feel like night today?
Something in here's not right today
Why am I so uptight today?
Paranoia's all I got left
I don't know what stressed me first
Or how the pressure was fed
But I know just what it feels like
To have a voice in the back of my head

Like a face that I hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face that watches every time I lie
A face that laughs every time I fall
(And watches everything)
So I know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is here in me
Right underneath my skin

It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

I know I've got a face in me
Points out all my mistakes to me
You've got a face on the inside, too
And your paranoia's probably worse
I don't know what set me off first
But I know what I can't stand
Everybody acts like the fact of the matter
Is I can't add up to what you can

But everybody has a face that they hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face that watches every time they lie
A face that laughs every time they fall
(And watches everything)
So you know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is watching you, too
Right inside your skin

It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath the skin
It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin

The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me
The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me

(The sun)It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath the skin(I feel the light betray me)
(The sun)It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within(I feel the light betray me)
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
(It's like)It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

Lyrics: 
Comin' on to the light of day, we got
Many moons that are deep at play so I
Keep an eye on the shadow smile to see what it has to say
You and I both know, everything must go away
Ah, what do you say?
Spinnin' knot that is on my heart is like a
Bit of light in a touch of dark, you got
Sneak attack from the zodiacbut I see your fire spark
Eat the breeze and go,blow by blow and go away
Oh, what do you say? Yeah

You don't know my mind, you don't know my kind
Dark necessities are part of my design and
Tell the world that I'm falling from the sky
Dark necessities are part of my design

Stumble down to the parking lot, you got
No time for the afterthought, they're like
Ice Cream for an Astronaut,well, that's me looking for we
Turn the corner and find the world at your command
Playin' the hand, yeah

You don't know my mind, you don't know my kind
Dark necessities are part of my design
Tell the world that I'm falling from the sky
Dark necessities are part of my design

Do you want this love of mine? Darkness helps us all to shine
Do you want it, do you want it now?
Do you want it all the time? But darkness helps us all to shine
Do you want it, do you want it now?

Ah, pick you up like a paperback with the
Track record of a maniac so I
Move it in and we unpack, it's the same as yesterday
Any way we roll, everything must go away
Oh, what do you say? Yeah

You don't know my mind, you don't know my kind
Dark necessities are part of my design
Tell the world that I'm falling from the sky and
Dark necessities are part of my design

Don't know which way you wanna turn

I'm gonna take you down
Down down down
So don't you fool around
I'm gonna pull it pull it
Pull the trigger

Too many women too many pills, yeah
Shoot to thrill play to kill
I got my gun at the ready gonna fire at will

Lyrics:

I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
'Cause I try and I try and I try and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no

When I'm drivin' in my car
And that man comes on the radio
And he's tellin' me more and more
About some useless information
Supposed to fire my imagination

I can't get no, oh no no no
Hey hey hey, that's what I say
I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
'Cause I try and I try and I try and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no

When I'm watchin' my TV
And that man comes on to tell me
How white my shirts can be
But he can't be a man 'cause he doesn't smoke
The same cigarettes as me

I can't get no, oh no no no
Hey hey hey, that's what I say
I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no girl reaction
Cause I try and I try and I try and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no

When I'm ridin' round the world
And I'm doin' this and I'm signing that
And I'm tryin' to make some girl
Who tells me baby better come back later next week
Cause you see I'm on losing streak

I can't get no, oh no no no
Hey hey hey, that's what I say
I can't get no, I can't get no
I can't get no satisfaction
No satisfaction, no satisfaction, no satisfaction

When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign

Lyrics:
Oh when you walk by every night
Talking sweet and looking fine
I get kind of hectic inside
Oh baby I'm so into you
Darling if you only knew
All the things that flow through my mind
But it's just a

Sweet sweet fantasy baby
When I close my eyes
You come and take me
On and on and on
It's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet sweet fantasy baby

Images of rapture
Creep into me slowly
As you're going to my head
And my heart beats faster
When you take me over
Time and time and time again
But it's just a

I'm in heaven
With my boyfriend
My laughing boyfriend
There's no beginning and there is no end
Feels like I'm dreaming but I'm not sleeping

Lyrics:
Ground Control to Major Tom
Ground Control to Major Tom
Take your protein pills 
and put your helmet on

Ground Control to Major Tom
Commencing countdown, 
engines on
Check ignition 
and may God's love be with you

Ten, Nine, Eight, Seven, Six, Five, Four, Three, Two, One, Liftoff

This is Ground Control 
to Major Tom
You've really made the grade
And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear
Now it's time to leave the capsule 
if you dare

This is Major Tom to Ground Control
I'm stepping through the door
And I'm floating 
in a most peculiar way
And the stars look very different today

For here
Am I sitting in a tin can
Far above the world
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do

Though I'm past 
one hundred thousand miles
I'm feeling very still
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
Tell my wife I love her very much 
she knows

Ground Control to Major Tom
Your circuit's dead,
there's something wrong
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you....

Here am I floating 
round my tin can
Far above the Moon
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do

About David Bowie:
David Bowie redefined musical genres and the potential of live performance for generations of music lovers. Creating and discarding a variety of personae and restlessly challenging musical boundaries, Bowie released timeless albums including Space Oddity, Hunky Dory, The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust…, Aladdin Sane, Diamond Dogs, Young Americans, Station to Station, ""Heroes,” Let's Dance, Heathen, The Next Day and many more. Blackstar, Bowie’s 28th and final studio album, was released on his 69th birthday, January 8, 2016. David Bowie died on January 10, 2016, two days after the release of Blackstar. His body of work, his influence on the worlds of music, art, fashion, film, theatre and beyond, and his legacy of innovation and reinvention will live forever. 2022 kicks off with Bowie at 75, a celebration of his 75th birthday with the Brilliant Adventure box set, the previously unreleased Toy, the 50th anniversary of Ziggy Stardust and a series of special events.

Lyrics:
Don't want to close my eyes
I don't want to fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you, baby
And I don't wanna miss a thing
'Cause even when I dream of you (even when I dream)
The sweetest dream would never do
I'd still miss you, babe
And I don't want to miss a thing

Written & Composed by Michael Jackson
Produced by Quincy Jones for Quincy Jones Productions
Co-Produced by Michael Jackson for MJJ Productions, Inc.
From the album Off the Wall, released August 10, 1979
Released as a single July 10, 1979

THE SHORT FILM
Director: Nick Saxon

Although all of Michael Jackson's music videos are referred to as short films, the short films for Off the Wall, Michael's first solo album for Epic Records, are more classic ""music videos,"" as they are performance clips rather than scripted stories.  Michael's short film for ""Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough"" was the first of the three short films produced for recordings from that album. The single reached No. 1 in eight countries in 1979, topping Billboard's Hot 100, Hot Soul Singles and Hot Disco Singles charts as well as the Cash Box Top 100.

""Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough"" was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America on November 29, 1979, and Platinum on February 14, 1989. The song won Michael his first solo Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance in 1980, as well as his first American Music Award for Favorite Single (Soul/R&B). ""Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough"" was ranked No. 9 on the 100 Best Songs of the '70s by NME and No. 16 on VH1's list of 100 Greatest Dance Songs.

""That song means a lot to me because it was the first song I wrote as a whole,"" Michael wrote in his 1988 memoir Moonwalk. ""'Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough' was my first big chance, and it went straight to Number One. It was the song that won me my first Grammy. Quincy had the confidence in me to encourage me to go into the studio by myself, which I appreciated.""

The short film featured Michael in performance against a dazzling background of geometric shapes and patterns. Wearing a tuxedo similar to his outfit on the Off the Wall album cover, Jackson sings and dances to the song, at one point even dancing with two other clones of himself, achieved through the magic of special effects.

I’ll be in my castle golden
But until the gates are open

Lyrics:

Esa mujer me esta matando 
Por mas que trato de olvidarla 
Me a espinado el corazon 
Mi alma no da razon 
Mi corazon aplastado 
Herido y abandonado 
A ver a ver tu sabes dime mi amor por favor 
Que dolor nos quedo 
Ah ah ah corazon espinado 
Ah ah ah como me duele el amor 
Como duele como duele el corazon 
Cuando nostiene entregados 
Pero no olvides mujer que algun dia diras 
Hay ya yay como me duele el amor 
Como me duele el olvido 
Como duele el corazon 
Como me duele estar vivo 
Sin tenerte aun lado amor 
Corazon espinado""

The Rolling Stones performing ""Sympathy For The Devil"" from The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus

Recorded before a live audience in London in 1968, The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus was originally conceived as a BBC-TV special. Directed by Michael Lindsay-Hogg, it centers on the original line up of The Rolling Stones -- Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Brian Jones, Charlie Watts, Bill Wyman (with Nicky Hopkins and Rocky Dijon) -- who serves as both the show’s hosts and featured attraction. For the first time in front of an audience, “The World’s Greatest Rock and Roll Band” performs six Stones classics. The program also includes extraordinary performances by The Who, Jethro Tull, Taj Mahal, Marianne Faithfull, Yoko Ono, and The Dirty Mac. A ‘supergroup’ before the term had even been coined, the band was comprised of Eric Clapton (lead guitar), Keith Richards (bass), Mitch Mitchell of The Jimi Hendrix Experience (drums), and John Lennon on guitar and vocals.

Lyrics:

Remember those walls I built?
Well, baby they're tumbling down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound
I found a way to let you in
But, I never really had a doubt
Standing in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm taking
I ain't never gonna shut you out!

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Lay, lady, lay
Lay across my big brass bed
Lay, lady, lay
Lay across my big brass bed
Whatever colors you have in your mind
I’ll show them to you and you’ll see them shine

[Verse 2]
Lay, lady, lay
Lay across my big brass bed
Stay, lady, stay
Stay with your man awhile
Until the break of day, let me see ya' make him smile
His clothes are dirty but his, his hands are clean
And you’re the best thing that he’s ever seen

[Verse 3]
Stay, lady, stay
Stay with your man awhile
Why wait any longer for the world to begin
You can have your cake and eat it too
Why wait any longer for the one you love
When he’s standing in front of you

[Verse 4]
Lay, lady, lay
Lay across my big brass bed
Stay, lady, stay
Stay while the night is still ahead
I long to see you in the morning light
I long to reach for you in the night
Stay, lady, stay
Stay while the night is still ahead

Lyrics

Like a warrior that fights
And wins the battle
I know the taste of victory
Though I went through some nights
Consumed by shadows
I was crippled emotionally

Somehow I made it through the heartache
Yes I did. I escaped.
I found my way out of the darkness
I kept my faith (I know you did), kept my faith

When the river was deep I didn't falter
When the mountain was high I still believed
When the valley was low it didn't stop me, no no
I knew you were waiting.
I knew you were waiting for me

With an endless desire
I kept on searching
Sure in time our eyes would meet
Like the bridge is on fire
The hurt is over,
One touch and you set me free

No, I don't regret a single moment,
No, I don't (I know you don't) looking back
When I think of all those disappointments
I just laugh (I know you do), I just laugh

When the river was deep I didn't falter
When the mountain was high I still believed
When the valley was low it didn't stop me
I knew you were waiting.
I knew you were waiting for me

So we were drawn together through destiny (oh, boy)
I know this love we shared was meant to be

I knew you were waiting,
Knew you were waiting
I knew you were waiting,
Knew you were waiting for me

I didn't falter
I still believed
When the valley was low it didn't stop me
I knew you were waiting.
I knew you were waiting for me

I didn't falter
When the mountain was high I still believed
When the valley was low it didn't stop me
I knew you were waiting.

Lyrics:
It's late in the evening, she's wondering what clothes to wear
She puts on her make-up and brushes her long blonde hair
And then she asks me, ""Do I look all right?""
And I say, ""Yes, you look wonderful tonight""

We go to a party and everyone turns to see
This beautiful lady that's walking around with me
And then she asks me ""Do you feel all right?""
And I say, ""Yes, I feel wonderful tonight""

I feel wonderful because I see
The love light in your eyes
And the wonder of it all
Is that you just don't realize how much I love you

It's time to go home now and I've got an aching head
So I give her the car keys and she helps me to bed
And then I tell her, as I turn out the light
I say, ""My darling, you were wonderful tonight
Oh my darling, you were wonderful tonight""

Boy don't you know you can't escape me

No way you're never gonna shake me
Ooh darling 'cause you'll always be my baby

#BEYONCE #RENAISSANCE 


I’m one of one
I’m number one 
I’m the only one
Don't even waste your time
Trying to compete with me 
No one else in this world can think like me 
I'm twisted  
I’ll contradict it
Keep him addicted 
Lies on his lips, I lick it  
  
Unique 
That’s what you are 
Stilettos kicking vintage crystal off the bar 
Category  
Bad bitch
I’m the bar 
Alien Superstar
Whip, whip

I’m too classy for this world 
Forever I’m that girl
Feed you diamonds and pearls 
Ooh baby I'm
Too classy to be touched 
I paid them all in dust
I’m stingy with my love

Ooh baby I’m
U-N-I-Q-U-E
Oh I’m stingy with my love
Ooh baby I’m
U-N-I-Q-U-E
Oh I’m stingy with my love

Unicorn is the uniform you put on
Eyes on you when you perform
Eyes on I when I put on
Mastermind their haute couture
Label whores can’t clock I’m so obscure 
Masterpiece genius, drip intravenous
Patty cake on that wrist 
Tiffany blue billboards over that ceiling 
We don’t like plain
Always dreamed of paper planes 
Mile high when I rodeo
Then I come down and take off again
You see pleasure in my glare 
Look over my shoulder and you ain’t scared 
The effects you have on me when you stare
Head on a pillow hike it in the air

I’m too classy for this world 
Forever I’m that girl
Feed you diamonds and pearls 
Ooh baby I'm too classy to be touched 
I paid them all in dust
I’m stingy with my love

Ooh baby
U-N-I-Q-U-E
U-N-I-Q-U-E

I got pearls beneath my legs my lips my hands my hips 
I got diamonds beneath my thighs where his ego will find bliss 
Can’t find an ocean deep that can compete with this cinnamon kiss 
Fire beneath your feet 
Music when you speak you’re so 
Unique

That’s what you are 
Lingerie reflecting off the mirror on the bar 
Category 
Sexy bitch, I’m the bar  
Alien superstar

We just reaching out to the solar
System, we flying over
Bullshit we flying over  
Supernatural love up in the air
I just talk my shit Casanova
Superstar, supernova
Power pull ‘em in closer

LYRICS:
[Verse 1]
I don't need your sympathy
There's nothing you can say or do for me
And I don't want a miracle
You'll never change for no one
And I hear your reasons why
Where did you sleep last night?
And was she worth it, was she worth it?

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm strong enough to live without you
Strong enough and I quit crying
Long enough, now I'm strong enough
To know you gotta go
There's no more to say
So save your breath and walk away
No matter what I hear you say
I'm strong enough to know you gotta go

[Verse 2]
So you feel misunderstood
Baby have I got news for you
On being used, I could write the book
But you don't wanna hear about it
'Cause I've been losing sleep
And you've been going cheap
She ain't worth half of me, it's true
Now I'm telling you, that

[Chorus]
I'm strong enough to live without you
Strong enough and I quit crying
Long enough, now I'm strong enough
To know you gotta go

[Bridge]
Come hell or waters high
You'll never see me cry
This is our last goodbye, it's true
I'm telling you, now

[Chorus]
I'm strong enough to live without you
Strong enough and I quit crying
Long enough, now I'm strong enough
To know you gotta go
There's no more to say
So save your breath and walk away
No matter what I hear you say
I'm strong enough to know you gotta go
Now I'm strong enough to live without you
Strong enough and I quit crying
Long enough, now I'm strong enough
To know you gotta go
There's no more to say
So save your breath and walk away
No matter what I hear you say
I'm strong enough to know you gotta go

Lyrics:

Someone told me long ago 
There's a calm before the storm, 
I know, 
It's been comin' for some time. 
When it's over, so they say, 
It'll rain a sunny day, 
I know, 
Shinin' down like water. 

I want to know, have you ever seen the rain? 
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain 
Comin' down on a sunny day?""",0.808,32880.0,album,https://open.spotify.com/artist/2y8Jo9CKhJvtfeKOsYzRdT,0.615,192147.0,True,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oX2FSv4Rys,Still The Same...

Lyrics:

Maria Maria 
She reminds me of a west side story 
Growing up in Spanish Harlem 
She's living the life just like a movie star 
Maria Maria 
She fell in love in East L.A. 
To the sounds of the guitar, yeah, yeah 
Played by Carlos Santana 
Stop the looting, stop the shooting 
Pick pocking on the corner 
See as the rich is getting richer 
The poor is getting poorer 
Se mira Maria on the corner 
Thinking of ways to make it better 
In my mailbox there's an eviction letter 
Somebody just said see you later 
Ahora vengo mama chola mama chola""",0.601,50459.0,album,https://open.spotify.com/artist/6GI52t8N5F02MxU0g5U69P,0.777,261973.0,True,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPLV7lGbmT4,Supernatural (Legacy Edition),"1,490.9",0.57,3.0,1966–present,United States,100 million,Rock,1969,62.8 million
